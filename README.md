## How to watch

There are two versions:

- [full subtitles, with English and foreign languages translated](/full-with-english/)
- foreign languages translated only (TODO)

These subtitles are made for the Extended versions only. VLC player is recommended to display subtitle colors as intended.

Also, reducing the text size can be useful for the full subtitles version as a lot of text can be displayed at once. For this, you can change it in VLC in the menu `Tools > Preferences > Subtitles > Subtitle Effects > Font Size > Smaller`.

## Language colors

$\color{#0080C0}{\textsf{Quenya}}$

$\color{#008000}{\textsf{Sindarin}}$

$\color{#778899}{\textsf{Aduna√Æc}}$

$\color{#FF0000}{\textsf{Black Speech of Mordor}}$

$\color{#FF8000}{\textsf{Khuzdul / Neo-Khuzdul}}$

$\color{#800080}{\textsf{Rohirric}}$

## Credits

I could not have done this without building upon other people's work, including mainly these fantastic resources:

- LeithioiPhilinn on Subscene (original link is dead)
- FUNKSW on Subscene (original link is dead)
- MidlandsSingingLessons ([FOTR](http://www.midlandsinginglessons.com/fotr-Lyrics.html), [TTT](http://www.midlandsinginglessons.com/TTT-Lyrics.html), [ROTK](http://www.midlandsinginglessons.com/ROTK-Lyrics.html))
- [A Magpie's Nest](https://web.archive.org/web/20200224164910/http://www.amagpiesnest.com/main.htm)
- [Complete Elvish LOTR subtitles by howa003](https://github.com/howa003/complete-elvish-lotr-subtitles) - more litteral translations, some songs are not included, only the Fellowhip of the Ring is complete
- [LOTR Subs by genekellyjr](https://github.com/genekellyjr/LOTR-Subs) - might have more versions available and instructions on how to adapt timing if necessary, only the Fellowhip of the Ring is complete

I also used a lot of other pages for small cross-checks that would be too long to list here.

## How to thank me

It took me tens of hours to do this, so if you like these subs please share them to every Lord of the Rings fan out there, that's the best way to thank me!

Contributions are welcome if you notice a mistake.
