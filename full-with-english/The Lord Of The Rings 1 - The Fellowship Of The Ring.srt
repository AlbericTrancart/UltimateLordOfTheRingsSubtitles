00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,749

11
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:51,549
Much that once was...

12
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:53,849
...is lost.

13
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:56,849
For none now live who remember it.

14
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:14,249
It began with the forging of the great rings.

15
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,449
Three were given to the elves:

16
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:21,550
Immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings.

17
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:24,049
Seven to the dwarf-lords:

18
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:28,949
Great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls.

19
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:30,449
And nine...

20
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,649
...nine rings were gifted to the race of men...

21
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:38,549
...who, above all else, desire power.

22
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:45,050
For within these rings was bound
the strength and will to govern each race.

23
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:48,759
But they were all of them deceived.

24
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,659
For another ring was made.

25
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:55,659
In the land of Mordor,
in the fires of Mount Doom...

26
00:01:55,660 --> 00:02:00,359
... the Dark Lord Sauron forged
in secret a master ring...

27
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,559
... to control all others.

28
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,759
And into this ring he poured
his cruelty, his malice...

29
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:11,959
...and his will to dominate all life.

30
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:16,659
One ring to rule them all.

31
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,459
One by one...

32
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:23,359
... the free lands of Middle-earth
fell to the power of the ring.

33
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,959
But there were some who resisted.

34
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:31,759
A last alliance of men and elves
marched against the armies of Mordor.

35
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:37,760
And on the slopes of Mount Doom, they
fought for the freedom of Middle-earth.

But the power of the ring...

... when all hope had faded...

48
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:52,870
... that Isildur, son of the king,
took up his father's sword.

49
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:30,380
Sauron, the enemy of the free peoples
of Middle-earth, was defeated.

50
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,479
The ring passed to Isildur...

51
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:43,379
... who had this one chance to destroy evil forever.

52

...are easily corrupted.

54
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:54,380
And the ring of power has a will of its own.

55
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:22,290
It betrayed Isildur...

56
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:26,590
... to his death.

57
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:33,389
And some things
that should not have been forgotten...

58
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:36,489
...were lost.

59
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:38,989
History became legend...

60
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:41,189
...legend became myth.

61
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:44,289
And for two and a half thousand years...

62
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:48,589
... the ring passed out of all knowledge.

63
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:52,089
Until, when chance came...

64
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:56,590
...it ensnared a new bearer.

65
00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:00,000

00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:04,389
The ring came to the creature Gollum...

68
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:08,589
... who took it deep into the tunnels
of the Misty Mountains.

69
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:11,689
And there it consumed him.

70
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:13,889
It came to me.

71
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:18,589

The ring brought to Gollum unnatural long life.

For 500 years it poisoned his mind.

75
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:39,299
And in the gloom of Gollum's cave, it waited.

76
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,899
Darkness crept back into the forests of the world.

77
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,899
Rumor grew of a shadow in the East...

78
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,899
... whispers of a nameless fear.

79
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:52,499

00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,600
...its time had now come.

81
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:00,999
It abandoned Gollum.

82
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,299
But something happened then
the ring did not intend.

83
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:11,099
It was picked up by the most
unlikely creature imaginable.

84
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,399
What's this?

85

Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.

87
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,899
A ring.

88
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,200
Lost!

89
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:27,199
My precious is lost!

00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,799
For the time will soon come...

...in the year 1400...

94
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,809
...by Shire-reckoning.

95
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:54,809
Bag End, Bagshot Row.
Hobbiton, Westfarthing...

96
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:57,009
...the Shire...

97
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:01,210
...Middle-earth.

98
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:09,110
The third age of this world.

99
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:16,510


100
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:23,410
There and back again.

101
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,909
A Hobbit's tale.

102
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:31,210
By Bilbo Baggins.

103
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:37,109
Now...

104
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:40,409
...where to begin?

105
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:42,910
Ah, yes....

106
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:48,909
"Concerning...

107
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:51,609
...Hobbits."

108
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:55,309
Hobbits have been living and farming
in the four Farthings of the Shire...

109
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:57,519
...for many hundreds of years...

110
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,719
...quite content to ignore and be ignored...

111
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,219
...by the world of the big folk.

112
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:10,019
Middle-earth being, after all,
full of strange creatures beyond count...

113
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:13,419
...Hobbits must seem of little importance...

114
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:17,619
...being neither renowned as great warriors...

115
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:23,120
...nor counted among the very wise.

116
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,319
Frodo! Someone at the door.

117
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,119
In fact, it has been remarked by some...

118
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,919
... that Hobbits' only real passion is for food.

119
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,319
A rather unfair observation...

120
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,419
...as we have also developed a keen
interest in the brewing of ales...

121
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:47,619
...and the smoking of pipe-weed.

122
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,619
But where our hearts truly lie...

123
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,519
...is in peace and quiet...

124
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,819
...and good, tilled earth.

125
00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:02,320
For all Hobbits share a love of things that grow.

126
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:08,719
And yes, no doubt to others our ways seem quaint.

127
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:14,519
But today of all days.
It is brought home to me...

128
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:21,720
It is no bad thing to celebrate a simple life.

129
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:29,230
Frodo, the door!

130
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,729
Sticklebacks. Where is that boy?

131
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:36,930
Frodo!

132
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:46,130
<i>Down from the door where it began</i>

133
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:54,429
<i>And I must follow if I can</i>

134
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:58,729
<i>The road goes ever on and on</i>

135
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:02,429
<i>Down from the door where it began</i>

136
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:08,029
<i>Now far ahead the road has gone</i>

137
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:13,130
<i>And I must follow if I can</i>
- You're late.

138
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:19,639
A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins.

139
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:25,640
Nor is he early.
He arrives precisely when he means to.

140
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:40,040
It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf!

141
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:47,640
You didn't think I'd miss
your Uncle Bilbo's birthday?

142
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,739
How is the old rascal?

143
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:54,439
I hear it's going to be a party
of special magnificence.

144
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,039
You know Bilbo.
He's got the whole piece in an uproar.

145
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,139
Well, that should please him.

146
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,339
Half the Shire's been invited.

147
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:05,340
And the rest of them are turning up anyway.

148
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,639
And so life in the Shire goes on...

149
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,839
... very much as it has this past age.

150
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:19,439
Full of its own comings and goings,
with change coming slowly.

151
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,739
If it comes at all.

152
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:26,339
For things are made to endure in the Shire...

153
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:30,239
...passing from one generation to the next.

154
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,439
There's always been a Baggins
living here under the Hill...

155
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,240
...in Bag End.

156
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:43,049
And there always will be.

157
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:47,649
To tell you the truth,
Bilbo's been a bit odd lateIy.

158
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:50,949
I mean, more than usual.

159
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:54,250
He's taken to locking himself in his study.

160
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:59,950
He spends hours and hours poring over
old maps when he thinks I'm not looking.

161
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:14,450
Where's it gone?

162
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:43,250
He's up to something.

163
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:52,659
- All right, then. Keep your secrets.
- What?

164
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,649
But I know you have something to do with it.

165
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:56,159
Good gracious me.

166
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,159
Before you came along, we Bagginses
were very well thought of.

167
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,359
Indeed.

168
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,159
Never had any adventures
or did anything unexpected.

169
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:09,159
If you're referring to the incident with the dragon.
I was barely involved.

170
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:12,959
All I did was give your uncle
a little nudge out of the door.

171
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:17,559
Whatever you did, you've been officially
labeled a disturber of the peace.

172
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,860
Oh, really?

173
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:28,460
Gandalf! Gandalf!

174
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,860
Fireworks, Gandalf!

175
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:41,460
- Gandalf!
- Fireworks, Gandalf!

176
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,559
Gandalf?

177
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:05,960
- I'm glad you're back.
- So am I, dear boy.

178
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:12,360
So am I.

179
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:44,369
No, thank you!

180
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:48,569
We don't want any more visitors,
well-wishers or distant relations!

181
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:53,370
And what about very old friends?

182
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:57,569
Gandalf?

183
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:01,269
- Bilbo Baggins.
- My dear Gandalf!

184
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:07,670
Good to see you. 111 years old!
Who would believe it?

185
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:11,570
You haven't aged a day.

186
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:18,969
Come on, come in!

187
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:22,579
Welcome, welcome.

188
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:26,480
Oh, here we are.

189
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:29,379
Tea...or maybe something a littIe stronger?

190
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:33,379
I've got a few bottles of the old winyard left - 1296.

191
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:38,579
Very good year. Almost as old as I am.

192
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:43,279
It was laid down by my father.
What say we open one, eh?

193
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:47,280
Just tea, thank you.

194
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,179
I was expecting you sometime last week.

195
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,679
Not that it matters. You come and go as
you please. Always have and always will.

196
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:03,079
You caught me a bit unprepared I'm afraid.
We've only got cold chicken and a bit of pickle....

197
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:06,679
There's some cheese here.
No, that won't do.

198
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:11,279
We've got raspberry jam, an apple tart....

199
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,479
But not much for afters.
Oh, no, we're all right.

200
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:19,680
I've just found some sponge cake.

201
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,980
I could make you some eggs if you'd li...

202
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:30,089
- Just tea, thank you.
- Oh, right.

203
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:33,579
- You don't mind if I eat, do you?
- No, not at all.

204
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,679
Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins!

205
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,680
I'm not at home!

206
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:46,089
It's the Sackville-Bagginses.

207
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:48,789
- I know you're in there!
- They're after the house.

208
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:51,489
They've never forgiven me for living this long.

209
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:54,389
I've got to get away from these confounded
relatives, hanging on the bell all day...

210
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:57,189
...never giving me a moment's peace.

211
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:00,889
I want to see mountains again.
Mountains, Gandalf!

212
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:05,589
And then find somewhere quiet
where I can finish my book. Oh, tea.

213
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:09,789
- So you mean to go through with your plan?
- Yes, yes. It's all in hand.

214
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:13,390
All the arrangements are made.

215
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:16,289
Oh, thank you.

216
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:18,589
Frodo suspects something.

217
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:21,289
Of course he does. He's a Baggins...

218
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:24,489
...not some blockheaded Bracegirdle
from Hardbottle.

219
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:28,089
You will tell him, won't you?

220
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:31,590
- Yes, yes.
- He's very fond of you.

221
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:35,390
I know.

222
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:40,299
He'd probably come with me if I asked him.

223
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:45,000
I think in his heart, Frodo's
still in love with the Shire.

224
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,799
The woods, the fields.

225
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:51,500
Little rivers.

226
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:58,700
I am old, Gandalf.

227
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:05,200
I know I don't look it, but I'm
beginning to feel it in my heart.

228
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,799
I feel thin.

229
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,799
Sort of stretched...

230
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,399
...like butter scraped over too much bread.

231
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:19,999
I need a holiday. A very Long holiday.

232
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,600
And I don't expect I shall return.

233
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:30,100
In fact, I mean not to.

234
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:36,700
Old Toby.
The finest weed in the Southfarthing.

235
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,499
Gandalf, my old friend...

236
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:59,700
...this will be a night to remember.

237
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,509
Hello, hello.

238
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:27,609
Fatty Bolger. Lovely to see you.
Welcome, welcome.

239
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:31,510
Go on, Sam. Ask Rosie for a dance.

240
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:37,309
- I think I'll just have another ale.
- Oh, no, you don't.

241
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:40,610
Go on!

242
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:51,309
So there I was...

243
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:55,609
...at the mercy of three monstrous trolls.

244
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:57,709
And they were all arguing amongst themselves...

245
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:00,309
...about how they were going to cook us.

246
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:06,409
Whether it be turned on a spit, or to sit
on us one by one, squash us into jelly.

247
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:10,109
They spent so much time arguing
the whithertos and the whyfors...

248
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:14,719
...that the sun's first light
crept over the top of the trees...

249
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,620
...and turned them all to stone!

250
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:25,420
Quickly.

251
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,620
Up they go!

252
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:35,820
No no, the big one - big one

253
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:46,419
Mrs. Bracegirdle, how nice to see you.
Welcome, welcome.

254
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,519
Are all these children yours?

255
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:52,920
Good gracious, you have been productive.

256
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,320
Bilbo?

257
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,519
Sackville-Bagginses!

258
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:01,020
Quickly, hide!

259
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,120
Thank you, my boy.

260
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:16,819
You're a good lad, Frodo.

261
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:20,019
I'm very selfish, you know.

262
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:23,929
Yes, I am. Very selfish.

263
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:26,329
I don't know why I took you in after
your mother and father died...

264
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:28,419
...but it wasn't out of charity.

265
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,919
I think it was because...

266
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,519
...of all my numerous relations...

267
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:36,429
...you were the one Baggins that showed real spirit.

268
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:38,429
Bilbo, have you been at the Gaffer's home brew?

269
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:40,329
No.

270
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:43,229
Well, yes, but that's not the point.

271
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:47,830
The point is, Frodo...

272
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:52,930
...you'll be all right.

273
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:57,129
- Done!
- You're supposed to stick it in the ground.

274
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:58,829
- It is in the ground.
- Outside!

275
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:01,830
This was your idea.

276
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:18,929
Bilbo.

277
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:21,829
Bilbo, watch out for the dragon!

278
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:26,630
Nonsense. There hasn't been a dragon
in these parts for thousands of years.

279
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:43,640
- That was good.
- Let's get another one.

280
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:48,339
Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took.

281
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:51,640
I might've known.

282
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:59,139
Speech, Bilbo!

283
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,639
Speech!

284
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,140
Speech!

285
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:09,939
My dear Bagginses and Boffins...

286
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:12,339
...Tooks and Brandybucks...

287
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:15,039
...Grubbs, Chubbs...

288
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,239
...Hornblowers...

289
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,339
...Bolgers...

290
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:21,139
...Bracegirdles...

291
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:25,140
...and Proudfoots.
- Proudfeet!

292
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:28,440
Today is my 111th birthday!

293
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,539
Happy birthday!

294
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:37,039
But alas, eleventh-one years is
far too short a time to live among...

295
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:40,939
...such excellent and admirable Hobbits.

296
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:43,849
I don't know half of you
half as well as I should like...

297
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:49,750
...and I like less than half of you
half as well as you deserve.

298
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:02,150
I have things to do.

299
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:10,650
I've put this off for far too long.

300
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:18,249
I regret to announce this is the end!

301
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,549
I'm going now.

302
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:24,850
I bid you all a very fond farewell.

303
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:28,450
Goodbye.

304
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:03,659
I suppose you think that was terribly clever.

305
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:07,159
Come on, Gandalf.
Did you see their faces?

306
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:10,059
There are many magic rings in
this world, Bilbo Baggins...

307
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:12,449
...and none of them should be used lightly.

308
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:14,759
It was just a bit of fun.

309
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:19,860
Oh, you're probably right, as usual.

310
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:23,659
- You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?
- Two eyes.

311
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:26,459
As often as I can spare them.

312
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:29,859
- I'm leaving everything to him.
- What about this ring of yours?

313
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:33,859
- Is that staying too?
- Yes, yes.

314
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:38,759
It's in an envelope over there on the mantelpiece.

315
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:43,160
No. Wait, it is...

316
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:48,360
...here in my pocket.

317
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:56,160
Isn't that--? Isn't that odd, now?

318
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:01,360
Yet, after all, why not?

319
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:06,759
- Why shouldn't I keep it?
- I think you should leave the ring behind.

320
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:09,159
Is that so hard?

321
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,960
Well, no.

322
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,860
And yes.

323
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:19,769
Now it comes to it,
I don't feel l ike parting with it.

324
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:21,769
It's mine. I found it! It came to me!

325
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:26,269
- There's no need to get angry.
- Well, if I'm angry, it's your fault!

326
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:29,470
It's mine.

327
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:32,269
My own.

328
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:36,469
- My precious.
- Precious?

329
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:39,569
It's been called that before, but not by you.

330
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:42,269
What business is it of yours
what I do with my own things?

331
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:45,269
I think you've had that ring quite long enough.

332
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:48,269
- You want it for yourself!
- Bilbo Baggins!

333
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:52,769
Do not take me for some conjurer of cheap tricks.

334
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:57,770
I am not trying to rob you.

335
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:04,570
I'm trying to help you.

336
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:15,269
All your long years, we've been friends.

337
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:18,870
Trust me as you once did.

338
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:22,279
Let it go.

339
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:26,080
You're right, Gandalf.

340
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:30,869
The ring must go to Frodo.

341
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:34,079
It's late. The road is long.

342
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,980
Yes, it is time.

343
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:45,580
Bilbo, the ring is still in your pocket.

344
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:23,480
I've thought up an ending for my book:

345
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:28,979
"And he lived happily ever after
to the end of his days."

346
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:33,379
And I'm sure you will, my dear friend.

347
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:36,280
Goodbye, Gandalf.

348
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:41,580
Goodbye, dear Bilbo.

349
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:53,590
<i>The road goes ever on and on...</i>

350
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:58,690
Until our next meeting.

351
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:28,389
It's mine. My own.

352
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:32,089
My precious.

353
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:35,289
Riddles in the dark.

354
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:36,889
Bilbo!

355
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:39,790
Bilbo!

356
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:46,490
My precious.

357
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:48,989
Precious.

358
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:52,890
He's gone, hasn't he?

359
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:57,589
He talked for so long about leaving...

360
00:30:57,590 --> 00:31:01,690
...I didn't think he'd really do it.

361
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:08,200
Gandalf?

362
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:16,949
Bilbo's ring.

363
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:19,549
He's gone to stay with the elves.

364
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:23,950
He's left you Bag End.

365
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:28,949
Along with all his possessions.

366
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:33,250
The ring is yours now.

367
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:38,049
- Put it somewhere out of sight.
- Where are you going?

368
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:40,549
- There are some things that I must see to.
- What things?

369
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:45,749
- Questions. Questions that need answering.
- You've only just arrived.

370
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:49,750
I don't understand.

371
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:54,150
Neither do I.

372
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:58,449
Keep it secret.

373
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:01,750
Keep it safe.

374
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:37,749

There's no Bagginses around here.
They're all up in Hobbiton.

There's been some strange folk crossing the Shire.

Dwarves and others of a less than savory nature.

407

War is brewing.

408
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,459
The mountains are fair teeming with goblins.

Far-off tales and children's stories, that's all that is.

You're beginning to sound like that old
Bilbo Baggins. Cracked, he was.

411
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,159
Young Mr. Frodo here, he's cracking.

412
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,659
And proud of it.

413
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:44,259
- Cheers, Gaffer.
- Aye. Cheers.

414

Weel it's none of our concern what
goes on beyond our borders.

415

Keep your nose out of trouble,
and no trouble'll come to you.

416
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,459
- Good night, lads.
- Good night.

417
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:03,159
Good night, sweet maiden of the golden ale.

418
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,759
Mind who you're sweet-taking.

419
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:11,249
Don't worry, Sam.
Rosie knows an idiot when she sees one.

420
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:13,059
Does she?

421
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:17,460
- Good night, Sam.
- Good night, Mr. Frodo.

422
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:44,760
Is it secret? Is it safe?

423
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:55,760
What are you doing?

424
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,759
Hold out your hand, Frodo.

425
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,360
It's quite cool.

426
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:17,560
What can you see?

427
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:21,760
Can you see anything?

428
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,059
Nothing.

429
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:28,259
There's nothing.

430
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:31,160
Wait.

432
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,460
There are markings.

433
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:41,159
It's some form of Elvish.
I can't read it.

434
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:44,259
There are few who can.

435
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:49,759
The language is that of Mordor,
which I will not utter here.

436
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,059
Mordor!

437
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,259
In the common tongue, it says:

438
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:57,059
"One ring to rule them all...

439
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:59,559
...One ring to find them...

440
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:02,059
...One ring to bring them all...

441
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:06,460
...and in the darkness bind them."

442
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,859
This is the One ring...

443
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:14,459
...forged by the Dark Lord Sauron
in the fires of Mount Doom.

444
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:19,259
Taken by IsiIdur from the hand of Sauron himself.

445
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:22,159
Bilbo found it.

446
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,359
- In Gollum's cave.
- Yes.

447
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:29,159
For 60 years, the ring lay quiet in Bilbo's keeping...

448
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:33,159
...prolonging his life, delaying old age.

449
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:37,759
But no longer, Frodo.
Evil is stirring in Mordor.

450
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,359
The ring has awoken.

451
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:43,259
It's heard its master's call.

452
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:48,000
But he was destroyed.
Sauron was destroyed.

No, Frodo.

455
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:59,459
The spirit of Sauron endured.

456
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:05,059
His life force is bound to the ring,
and the ring survived.

457
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:08,259
Sauron has returned.

458
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:10,559
His orcs have multiplied.

459
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:14,659
His fortress at Barad-dûr
is rebuilt in the land of Mordor.

460
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:19,669
Sauron needs only this ring to cover
all the lands in a second darkness.

461
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:21,959
He is seeking it.

462
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:26,059
Seeking it - All his thought is bent on it.

463
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:28,959
For the ring yearns above all else...

464
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,659
...to return to the hand of its master.

465
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:34,459
They are one...

466
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:37,859
...the ring and the Dark Lord.

467
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:39,359
Frodo...

468
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,459
...he must never find it.

469
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,869
All right.

470
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:47,469
We put it away. We keep it hidden.
We never speak of it again.

471
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:51,470
No one knows it's here, do they?

472
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:57,969
Do they, Gandalf?

473
00:39:57,970 --> 00:40:02,669
There is one other who knew
that Bilbo had the ring.

474
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:05,869
I looked everywhere for the creature Gollum.

475
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:09,370
But the enemy found him first.

476
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:12,469
I don't know how long they tortured him.

477
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:17,069
But amidst the endless screams and
inane babble, they discerned two words:

478
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:19,469
Shire!

479
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:21,269
Baggins!

480
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:23,269
Shire.

481
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:27,470
Baggins.
But that would lead them here!

482
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:31,470
Who goes there?

483
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:33,469
Take it, Gandalf!

484
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:34,569
- Take it!
- No, Frodo.

485
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:37,169
- You must take it!
- You cannot offer me this ring!

486
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:41,870
- I'm giving it to you!
- Don't tempt me, Frodo!

487
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:44,569
I dare not take it.

488
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:48,169
Not even to keep it safe.

489
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:50,869
Understand, Frodo...

490
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:55,870
...I would use this ring from a desire to do good.

491
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:06,269
But through me, it would wield a power
too great and terrible to imagine.

492
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:10,570
- But it cannot stay in the Shire!
- No.

493
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:14,070
No, it can't.

494
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:20,870
What must I do?

495
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:24,869
- You must leave. And leave quickly.
- Where? Where do I go?

496
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:28,369
Get out of the Shire.
Make for the village of Bree.

497
00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:29,669
Bree.

498
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:32,569
- What about you?
- I'll be waiting for you...

499
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:35,269
...at the inn of the Prancing Pony.

500
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:39,169
- And the ring will be safe there?
- I don't know, Frodo.

501
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:42,570
I don't have any answers.

502
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:48,369
I must see the head of my order.
He is both wise and powerful. Trust me, Frodo.

503
00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:51,169
He'll know what to do.

504
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:54,269
You'll have to leave the name
of Baggins behind you.

505
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:57,369
That name is not safe outside the Shire.

506
00:41:57,370 --> 00:42:01,369
Travel only by day.
And stay off the road.

507
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:05,970
I can cut across country easily enough.

508
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:08,669
My dear Frodo.

509
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:11,869
Hobbits really are amazing creatures.

510
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:14,969
You can learn all that there is to
know about their ways in a month.

511
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:17,569
And yet, after a hundred years...

512
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:20,970
...they can still surprise you.

513
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:24,070
Get down.

514
00:42:34,770 --> 00:42:38,469
Confound it all, Samwise Gamgee!
Have you been eavesdropping?

515
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:40,169
I haven't been dropping no eaves. Honest.

516
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:43,169
I was just cutting the grass under
the window there...If you follow me.

517
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:45,769
A little late for trimming the verge, don't you think?

518
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:48,769
- I heard raised voices.
- What did you hear? Speak!

519
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:50,469
Nothing important.

520
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:52,969
That is, I heard a good deal
about a ring, and a Dark Lord...

521
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:54,669
...and something about the end of the world but...

522
00:42:54,670 --> 00:43:00,269
Please, Mr. Gandalf, sir, don't hurt me.
Don't turn me into anything unnatural.

523
00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:03,069
No?

524
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:05,469
Perhaps not.

525
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:10,270
I've thought of a better use for you.

526
00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:14,970
Come along, Samwise. Keep up.

527
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:17,679
Be careful, both of you.

528
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,569
The enemy has many spies in his service:

529
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:24,870
Birds, beasts.

530
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:28,570
Is it safe?

531
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:30,369
Never put it on...

532
00:43:30,370 --> 00:43:33,869
...for the agents of the Dark Lord
will be drawn to its power.

533
00:43:33,870 --> 00:43:35,969
Always remember, Frodo...

534
00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:39,579
...the ring is trying to get back to its master.

535
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:43,080
It wants to be found.

536
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:24,779
This is it.

537
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:27,179
This is what?

538
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:29,779
If I take one more step...

539
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:34,980
...it'll be the farthest away
from home I've ever been.

540
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:40,880
Come on, Sam.

541
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:50,279
Remember what Bilbo used to say:

542
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:54,179
- "It's a dangerous business, Frodo."
- "Going out your door.

543
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:58,779
You step onto the road,
and if you don't keep your feet...

544
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:04,280
... there's no knowing where
you might be swept off to."

545
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:15,500

552
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:43,379
To the Grey Havens.

553
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:45,579
They're leaving Middle-earth.

554
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:47,800
Never to return.

I don't know why...

557
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:57,380
...it makes me sad.

558
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:03,379
Everywhere I lie there's a dirty
great root sticking into my back.

559
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:05,279
Just shut your eyes...

560
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,279
...and imagine you're back in your own bed...

561
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:13,580
...with a soft mattress and a lovely feather pillow.

562
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:24,279
It's not working, Mr. Frodo.

563
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:28,580
I'm never going to be able to sleep out here.

564
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:33,280
Me neither, Sam.

565
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:03,679
Smoke rises from the Mountain of Doom.

566
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,479
The hour grows late.

567
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:09,379
And Gandalf the Grey rides to Isengard...

568
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:11,979
...seeking my counsel.

569
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:16,079
For that is why you have come, is it not?

570
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,679
My old friend.

571
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:20,680
Saruman.

572
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:27,879
- You are sure of this?
- Beyond any doubt.

573
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:30,389
So the ring of power has been found.

574
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:33,779
All these long years, it was in the Shire.

575
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:37,589
- Under my very nose.
- Yet you did not have the wit to see it.

576
00:47:37,590 --> 00:47:42,689
Your love of the halfling's leaf
has clearly slowed your mind.

577
00:47:42,690 --> 00:47:47,089
But we still have time.
Time enough to counter Sauron if we act quickly.

578
00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:49,589
Time?

579
00:47:49,590 --> 00:47:52,589
What time do you think we have?

580
00:47:52,590 --> 00:47:56,689
Sauron has regained much of his former strength.

581
00:47:56,690 --> 00:47:59,079
He cannot yet take physical form...

582
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:02,389
...but his spirit has lost none of its potency.

583
00:48:02,390 --> 00:48:08,089
Concealed within his fortress,
the Lord of Mordor sees all.

584
00:48:08,090 --> 00:48:15,290
His gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth and flesh.

585
00:48:15,590 --> 00:48:19,589
You know of what I speak, Gandalf.

586
00:48:19,590 --> 00:48:25,789
A great eye, lidless, wreathed in flame.

587
00:48:25,790 --> 00:48:27,789
The eye of Sauron.

588
00:48:27,790 --> 00:48:30,789
He is gathering all evil to him.

589
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:32,789
Very soon, he'll have summoned an army...

590
00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:35,989
...great enough for an assault upon Middle-earth.

591
00:48:35,990 --> 00:48:38,889
You know this?

592
00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:40,989
How?

593
00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:43,089
I have seen it.

594
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:47,089
A palantir is a dangerous tool, Saruman.

595
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:48,989
Why?

596
00:48:48,990 --> 00:48:53,090
Why should we fear to use it?

597
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:58,489
They are not all accounted for,
the lost seeing-stones.

598
00:48:58,490 --> 00:49:03,090
We do not know who else may be watching.

599
00:49:04,290 --> 00:49:07,189
The hour is later than you think.

600
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:10,990
Sauron's forces are already moving.

601
00:49:11,790 --> 00:49:14,889
The Nine have left Minas Morgul.

602
00:49:14,890 --> 00:49:16,089
The Nine?

603
00:49:16,090 --> 00:49:19,389
They crossed the river Isen on Midsummer's Eve...

604
00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:22,289
...disguised as riders in black.

605
00:49:22,290 --> 00:49:27,590
- They've reached the Shire?
- They will find the ring.

606
00:49:27,790 --> 00:49:30,489
And kill the one who carries it.

607
00:49:30,490 --> 00:49:33,390
Frodo!

608
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:49,789
You did not seriously think that a hobbit
could contend with the will of Sauron?

609
00:49:49,790 --> 00:49:53,990
There are none who can.

610
00:49:55,090 --> 00:49:58,089
Against the power of Mordor...

611
00:49:58,090 --> 00:50:02,090
...there can be no victory.

612
00:50:02,690 --> 00:50:07,089
We must join with him, Gandalf.

613
00:50:07,090 --> 00:50:10,790
We must join with Sauron.

614
00:50:12,090 --> 00:50:15,289
It would be wise, my friend.

615
00:50:15,290 --> 00:50:16,889
Tell me...

616
00:50:16,890 --> 00:50:18,889
...friend...

617
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:24,790
...when did Saruman the Wise abandon reason for madness?

00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:44,789
- I thought I'd lost you.
- What are you taking about?

628
00:51:44,790 --> 00:51:48,699
- It's just something Gandalf said.
- What did he say?

629
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:52,899
"Don't you lose him, Samwise Gamgee."
And I don't mean to.

630
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:57,900
Sam, we're still in the Shire.
What could possibly happen?

631
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:00,699
Frodo.

632
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:03,199
- Merry, it's Frodo Baggins.
- Hello, Frodo.

633
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,089
Get off him.

634
00:52:05,090 --> 00:52:06,699
Come on, Frodo.

635
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:08,989
What's the meaning of this?

636
00:52:08,990 --> 00:52:13,299
You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop!

637
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:16,399
You get back here!

638
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,999
Get out of my field!

639
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,999
You'll know the devil if I catch up with you!

640
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,099
I don't know why he's so upset.
It's only a couple of carrots.

641
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:25,399
And some cabbages.

642
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:28,499
And those three bags of potatoes
that we lifted last week.

643
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:32,799
- And then the mushrooms the week before.
- Yes, Pippin. My point is...

644
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:35,199
...he's clearly overreacting.

645
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:38,100
Run!

646
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:53,799
Oh, that was close.

647
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:57,899
I think I've broken something.

648
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:00,399
Trust a Brandybuck and a Took!

649
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:04,299
What? That was just a detour.
A short cut.

650
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:08,000
- Short cut to what?
- Mushrooms!

651
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:18,200
That's mine.

652
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:21,699
That's nice, Merry.

653
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:23,899
Here's a nice one, Sam.

654
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:27,800
I think we should get off the road.

655
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:37,199
Get off the road!

656
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:40,100
Quick!

657
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:54,300
Be quiet!

658

Nothing.

What is going on?

664
00:55:41,310 --> 00:55:46,410
That Black Rider was looking for something.
Or someone.

665
00:55:46,410 --> 00:55:48,609
Frodo?

666
00:55:48,610 --> 00:55:51,110
Get down!

667
00:56:06,510 --> 00:56:09,809
I have to leave the Shire.

668
00:56:09,810 --> 00:56:12,309
Sam and I must get to Bree.

669
00:56:12,310 --> 00:56:15,109
Right.

670

Come on.

00:57:49,910 --> 00:57:54,710
- What do you want?
- We're heading for the Prancing Pony.

00:57:56,810 --> 00:57:59,809
Hobbits. Four hobbits!

688
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:04,309
What's more, out of the Shire by your talk.
What business brings you to Bree?

689
00:58:04,310 --> 00:58:08,509
We wish to stay at the inn.
Our business is our own.

690
00:58:08,510 --> 00:58:11,209
All right young sir, I meant no offense.

691
00:58:11,210 --> 00:58:14,009
It's my job to ask questions after nightfall.

692
00:58:14,010 --> 00:58:17,009
There's talk of strange folk abroad.

693
00:58:17,010 --> 00:58:20,610
Can't be too careful.

694
00:58:38,910 --> 00:58:43,710
Out of the way!
Watch where you're walking.

695
00:59:06,410 --> 00:59:09,009
Excuse me.

696
00:59:09,010 --> 00:59:12,009
Good evening, little masters.
What can I do for you?

697
00:59:12,010 --> 00:59:18,309
If you're looking for accommodation, we got
some nice cozy hobbit-sized rooms available.

698
00:59:18,310 --> 00:59:24,009
Always proud to cater to little folk, Mister...?

699
00:59:24,010 --> 00:59:27,409
Underhill. My name's Underhill.

700
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:30,109
- Underhill, yeah.
- We're friends of Gandalf the Grey.

701
00:59:30,110 --> 00:59:33,609
- Can you tell him we've arrived?
- Gandalf?

702
00:59:33,610 --> 00:59:36,209
Gandalf.

703
00:59:36,210 --> 00:59:38,109
Oh, yes...

704
00:59:38,110 --> 00:59:40,509
...I remember. Elderly chap.

705
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:43,819
Big grey beard, pointy hat.

706
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:47,120
Not seen him for six months.

707
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:55,320
What do we do now?

708
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:02,339
Sam...

709
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:05,640
...he'll be here. He'll come.

710
01:00:07,030 --> 01:00:10,530
Get out of my way!

711
01:00:11,530 --> 01:00:13,329
What's that?

712
01:00:13,330 --> 01:00:16,139
This, my friend, is a pint.

713
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:18,039
It comes in pints?

714
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:23,040
- I'm getting one.
- You got a whole half already!

715
01:00:28,030 --> 01:00:33,230
That fellow's done nothing but
stare at you since we arrived.

716
01:00:35,530 --> 01:00:38,430
Excuse me.

717
01:00:38,830 --> 01:00:43,029
That man in the corner. Who is he?

718
01:00:43,030 --> 01:00:47,529
He's one of them Rangers. They're dangerous
folk they are, wandering the wilds.

719
01:00:47,530 --> 01:00:53,430
What his right name is, I've never heard,
but 'round here he's known as Strider.

720
01:00:54,430 --> 01:00:57,130
Strider.

721
01:01:08,730 --> 01:01:13,330
Baggins...

722
01:01:15,030 --> 01:01:19,430
Baggins...

723
01:01:22,330 --> 01:01:25,929
Baggins...

724
01:01:25,930 --> 01:01:29,029
Baggins...

725
01:01:29,030 --> 01:01:32,629
<i>Baggins...
Baggins? Sure, I know a Baggins.</i>

726
01:01:32,630 --> 01:01:35,429
He's over there. Frodo Baggins.

727
01:01:35,430 --> 01:01:38,629
He's my second cousin,
once removed on his mother's side...

728
01:01:38,630 --> 01:01:42,330
...and my third cousin, twice removed....

729
01:01:45,430 --> 01:01:48,630
- Pippin!
- Steady on, Frodo.

730
01:02:16,730 --> 01:02:20,630
You cannot hide.

731
01:02:22,130 --> 01:02:26,630
I see you.

732

...death.

738
01:02:42,130 --> 01:02:48,330
You draw far too much attention
to yourself, "Mr. Underhill."

739
01:02:51,730 --> 01:02:52,919
What do you want?

740
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:55,429
A little more caution from you.
That is no trinket you carry.

741
01:02:55,430 --> 01:02:58,729
- I carry nothing.
- Indeed.

742
01:02:58,730 --> 01:03:01,419
I can avoid being seen if I wish...

743
01:03:01,420 --> 01:03:05,619
...but to disappear entirely, that is a rare gift.

744
01:03:05,620 --> 01:03:09,519
- Who are you?
- Are you frightened?

745
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:10,619
Yes.

746
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:15,920
Not nearly frightened enough.
I know what hunts you.

747
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:22,420
Let him go!
Or I'll have you, Longshanks.

748
01:03:22,820 --> 01:03:27,119
You have a stout heart, little hobbit.
But that will not save you.

749
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:30,219
You can no longer wait for the wizard, Frodo.

750
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:32,720
They're coming.

Great kings of men.

757
01:05:03,610 --> 01:05:07,409
Then Sauron the Deceiver gave to them
nine rings of power.

758
01:05:07,410 --> 01:05:10,709
Blinded by their greed,
they took them without question.

759

One by one, falling into darkness.

760

Now they are slaves to his will.

They are the Nazgul.

Ringwraiths. Neither living nor dead.

763
01:05:24,510 --> 01:05:26,009
At all times they feel...

764
01:05:26,010 --> 01:05:28,209
... the presence of the ring...

765
01:05:28,210 --> 01:05:34,010
...drawn to the power of the One.
They will never stop hunting you.

766
01:05:42,710 --> 01:05:47,010
- Where are you taking us?
- Into the wild.

767
01:05:53,910 --> 01:05:58,109
How can we know this Strider
is a friend of Gandalf?

768

I think a servant of the enemy would look fairer...

769
01:06:01,310 --> 01:06:05,809
...and feel fouler.
- He's foul enough.

770
01:06:05,810 --> 01:06:08,909
We have no choice but to trust him.

771
01:06:08,910 --> 01:06:13,610
- But where is he leading us?
- To Rivendell, Master Gamgee.

772
01:06:14,610 --> 01:06:18,509
- To the house of Elrond.
- Did you hear that? Rivendell.

773
01:06:18,510 --> 01:06:22,710
We're going to see the elves.

774
01:06:42,910 --> 01:06:47,309
- Gentlemen, we do not stop till nightfall.
- What about breakfast?

775
01:06:47,310 --> 01:06:50,209
- You've already had it.
- We've had one, yes.

776
01:06:50,210 --> 01:06:53,910
What about second breakfast?

777
01:06:55,810 --> 01:06:59,309
Don't think he knows about second breakfast, Pip.

778
01:06:59,310 --> 01:07:04,709
What about elevenses? Luncheon?
Afternoon tea? Dinner? Supper?

779
01:07:04,710 --> 01:07:10,210
- He knows about them, doesn't he?

01:25:08,430 --> 01:25:11,229
I was delayed.

910
01:25:11,230 --> 01:25:16,730
A friendship with Saruman
is not lightly thrown aside.

911
01:25:19,530 --> 01:25:24,529
One ill turn deserves another. It is over.

912
01:25:24,530 --> 01:25:27,829
Embrace the power of the ring...

...or embrace your own destruction!

915
01:25:32,630 --> 01:25:36,729
There is only one lord of the ring.

917
01:25:36,830 --> 01:25:41,610
Only one who can bend it to his will.

918
01:25:41,630 --> 01:25:46,930
And he does not share power.

919
01:25:59,830 --> 01:26:04,530
So you have chosen...death.

920
01:26:13,330 --> 01:26:18,129
Gandalf? What is it?

921
01:26:18,130 --> 01:26:20,529
Nothing, Frodo.

922
01:26:20,530 --> 01:26:23,829
Frodo!

923
01:26:23,830 --> 01:26:26,429
- Sam.
- Bless you, you're awake!

924
01:26:26,430 --> 01:26:29,429
Sam has hardly left your side.

925
01:26:29,430 --> 01:26:32,029
We were that worried about you.
Weren't we, Mr. Gandalf?

926
01:26:32,030 --> 01:26:38,430
By the skills of Lord Elrond,
you're beginning to mend.

927
01:26:38,530 --> 01:26:43,530
Welcome to Rivendell, Frodo Baggins.

- Hello, Frodo, my lad.

932
01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:36,920
Bilbo.

933
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:42,319
There and back again

934
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:46,520
A hobbit's Tale, by Bilbo Baggins.''

935
01:27:48,220 --> 01:27:52,019
- This is wonderful.
- I meant to go back...

936
01:27:52,020 --> 01:27:56,319
...wonder at the powers of Mirkwood...

937
01:27:56,320 --> 01:27:58,819
...visit Lake-town...

938
01:27:58,820 --> 01:28:02,819
...see the Lonely Mountain again.

939
01:28:02,820 --> 01:28:08,920
But age, it seems, has finally caught up with me.

940
01:28:19,820 --> 01:28:22,019
I miss the Shire.

941
01:28:22,020 --> 01:28:27,419
I spent all my childhood pretending
I was off somewhere else.

942
01:28:27,420 --> 01:28:32,320
Off with you, on one of your adventures.

943
01:28:33,820 --> 01:28:38,820
But my own adventure turned out
to be quite different.

944
01:28:42,820 --> 01:28:47,219
I'm not like you, Bilbo.

945
01:28:47,220 --> 01:28:50,820
My dear boy.

946
01:28:53,620 --> 01:28:54,819
Now, what have I forgotten?


947

<i><font color="#008000">♫ A, Elbereth Gil[thoniel]</font></i>

948
01:28:55,320 --> 01:28:58,219
Packed already?

949
01:28:58,220 --> 01:29:00,219
No harm in being prepared.

950
01:29:00,220 --> 01:29:03,019
- I thought you wanted to see the elves.
- I do.

951
01:29:03,020 --> 01:29:06,119
- More than anything.
- I did.

952
01:29:06,120 --> 01:29:08,819
It's just....

953
01:29:08,820 --> 01:29:11,619
We did what Gandalf wanted, didn't we?

954
01:29:11,620 --> 01:29:15,619
We got the ring this far, to Rivendell.
And I thought...

955
01:29:15,620 --> 01:29:19,019
...seeing as how you're on the mend,
we'd be off soon.

956
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:22,120
Off home.

957
01:29:24,820 --> 01:29:28,220
You are right, Sam.

958
01:29:29,020 --> 01:29:32,319
We did what we set out to do.

959
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:36,320
The ring will be safe in Rivendell.

960
01:29:39,020 --> 01:29:42,119
I am ready to go home.

961
01:29:42,120 --> 01:29:44,319
His strength returns.

962
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:50,719
That wound will never fully heal.
He will carry it the rest of his life.

963
01:29:50,720 --> 01:29:53,319
And yet to have come so far still bearing the ring...

964
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:57,309
...the Hobbit has shown extraordinary
resilience to its evil.

965
01:29:57,310 --> 01:30:00,919
It is a burden he should never have had to bear.

966
01:30:00,920 --> 01:30:06,439
- We can ask no more of Frodo.
- Gandalf, the enemy is moving.

967
01:30:06,440 --> 01:30:11,339
Sauron's forces are massing in the East.
His eye is fixed on Rivendell.

968
01:30:11,340 --> 01:30:14,339
And Saruman, you tell me, has betrayed us.

969
01:30:14,340 --> 01:30:18,239
Our list of allies grows thin.

970
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:21,239
His treachery runs deeper than you know.

971
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:25,139
By foul craft, Saruman
has crossed orcs with goblin-men.

972
01:30:25,140 --> 01:30:27,839
He's breeding an army in the caverns of Isengard.

973
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:32,649
An army that can move in sunlight
and cover great distance at speed.

974
01:30:32,650 --> 01:30:35,449
Saruman is coming for the ring.

975
01:30:35,450 --> 01:30:39,749
This evil cannot be concealed
by the power of the elves.

976
01:30:39,750 --> 01:30:45,450
We do not have the strength to
fight both Mordor and Isengard!

977
01:30:47,960 --> 01:30:50,359
Gandalf...

978
01:30:50,360 --> 01:30:54,260
...the ring cannot stay here.

979
01:31:12,470 --> 01:31:15,869
This peril belongs to all Middle-earth.

980
01:31:15,870 --> 01:31:19,679
They must decide now how to end it.

981
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:23,879
The time of the elves is over.
My people are leaving these shores.

982
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:27,779
Who will you look to when we've gone?
The dwarves?

983
01:31:27,780 --> 01:31:34,180
They hide in mountains seeking riches.
They care not for the troubles of others.

984
01:31:34,380 --> 01:31:37,689
It is in men that we must place our hope.

985
01:31:37,690 --> 01:31:40,289
Men?

986
01:31:40,290 --> 01:31:43,689
Men are weak. The race of men is failing.

987
01:31:43,690 --> 01:31:48,389
The blood of Numenor is all but spent,
its pride and dignity forgotten.

988
01:31:48,390 --> 01:31:52,189
It is because of men the ring survives.

989
01:31:52,190 --> 01:31:54,499
I was there, Gandalf.

990
01:31:54,500 --> 01:31:58,700
I was there 3000 years ago...

991
01:32:04,100 --> 01:32:06,699
... when Isildur took the ring.

992
01:32:06,700 --> 01:32:11,900
I was there the day the strength of men failed.

993
01:32:13,110 --> 01:32:17,110
Isildur, hurry! Follow me.

994
01:32:17,310 --> 01:32:21,209
I led Isildur into the heart of Mount Doom...

995
01:32:21,210 --> 01:32:24,809
...where the ring was forged,
the one place it could be destroyed.

996
01:32:24,810 --> 01:32:28,810
Cast it into the fire!

997
01:32:32,620 --> 01:32:37,720
- Destroy it!
- No.

998
01:32:37,720 --> 01:32:40,319
Isildur!

999
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:46,420
It should have ended that day,
but evil was allowed to endure.

1000
01:32:49,220 --> 01:32:54,329
Isildur kept the ring.
The line of kings is broken.

1001
01:32:54,330 --> 01:32:58,329
There's no strength left in the world of men.

1002
01:32:58,330 --> 01:33:03,329
- They're scattered, divided, leaderless.
- There is one who could unite them.

1003
01:33:03,330 --> 01:33:08,030
One who could reclaim the throne of Gondor.

1004
01:33:08,440 --> 01:33:12,339
He turned from that path a long time ago.

1005
01:33:12,340 --> 01:33:15,940
He has chosen exile.

1006
01:33:45,560 --> 01:33:47,759
You are no elf.

1007
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:50,459
Men of the South are welcome here.

1008
01:33:50,460 --> 01:33:55,360
- Who are you?
- I am a friend to Gandalf the Grey.

1009
01:33:55,460 --> 01:33:58,559
Then we are here on common purpose...

1010
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:01,460
...friend.

1011
01:34:15,370 --> 01:34:19,670
The shards of Narsil.

1012
01:34:21,780 --> 01:34:27,480
The blade that cut the ring from Sauron's hand.

1013
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:32,780
It's still sharp.

1014
01:34:40,290 --> 01:34:44,690
But no more than a broken heirloom.

1015
01:35:10,200 --> 01:35:14,109
Why do you fear the past?

1016
01:35:14,110 --> 01:35:19,709
You are Isildur's heir, not Isildur himseIf.

1017
01:35:19,710 --> 01:35:23,609
You are not bound to his fate.

1018
01:35:23,610 --> 01:35:28,910
The same blood flows in my veins.

1019
01:35:30,620 --> 01:35:34,620
The same weakness.

1020
01:35:35,890 --> 01:35:38,889
Your time will come.

1021
01:35:38,890 --> 01:35:44,590
You will face the same evil.
And you will defeat it.

01:38:41,090 --> 01:38:43,589
...but in the West a pale light lingered.

1055
01:38:43,590 --> 01:38:45,689
A voice was crying:

1056
01:38:45,690 --> 01:38:49,689
"Your doom is near at hand.

1057
01:38:49,690 --> 01:38:53,790
Isildur's bane is found."

Never before has any voice uttered the
words of that tongue here in Imladris.

1069
01:39:27,270 --> 01:39:31,069
I do not ask your pardon, Master Elrond...

1070
01:39:31,070 --> 01:39:33,469
...for the black speech of Mordor...

1071
01:39:33,470 --> 01:39:35,069
...may yet be heard...

1072
01:39:35,070 --> 01:39:38,169
...in every corner of the West!

1073
01:39:38,170 --> 01:39:41,269
The ring is altogether evil.

1074
01:39:41,270 --> 01:39:43,459
It is a gift.

1075
01:39:43,460 --> 01:39:46,059
A gift to the foes of Mordor.

1076
01:39:46,060 --> 01:39:48,359
Why not use this ring?

1077
01:39:48,360 --> 01:39:51,359
Long has my father, the Steward of Gondor...

1078
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:55,959
...kept the forces of Mordor at bay.
By the blood of our people...

1079
01:39:55,960 --> 01:39:59,560
...are your lands kept safe.

1080
01:39:59,860 --> 01:40:04,449
Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy.
Let us use it against him.

1081
01:40:04,450 --> 01:40:08,849
You cannot wield it. None of us can.

1082
01:40:08,850 --> 01:40:13,149
The one ring answers to Sauron alone.
It has no other master.

1083
01:40:13,150 --> 01:40:16,849
And what would a ranger know of this matter?

1084
01:40:16,850 --> 01:40:19,839
This is no mere ranger.

1085
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:24,039
He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

1086
01:40:24,040 --> 01:40:28,340
You owe him your allegiance.

1087
01:40:31,040 --> 01:40:34,440
Aragorn.

1088
01:40:34,740 --> 01:40:39,040
This is Isildur's heir?

1089
01:40:39,940 --> 01:40:44,140
And heir to the throne of Gondor.

1090

Gondor has no king.

1092
01:40:54,330 --> 01:40:57,430
Gondor needs no king.

1093
01:41:02,620 --> 01:41:07,319
Aragorn is right. We cannot use it.

1094
01:41:07,320 --> 01:41:10,919
You have only one choice.

1095
01:41:10,920 --> 01:41:14,720
The ring must be destroyed.

1096
01:41:18,520 --> 01:41:22,520
Then what are we waiting for?

1097
01:41:26,550 --> 01:41:32,550
<font color="#FF0000">...Daghburz-ishi makha gulshu... sherkuk</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">...In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows... blood</font>

1098
01:41:33,470 --> 01:41:36,769
The ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli, son of Gloin...

1099
01:41:36,770 --> 01:41:41,569
...by any craft that we here possess.

1100
01:41:41,570 --> 01:41:45,659
The ring was made in the fires of Mount Doom.

1101
01:41:45,859 --> 01:41:50,640
<i><font color="#FF0000">[Daghburz]-ishi makha gulshu darulu</font></i>

1102
01:41:45,860 --> 01:41:50,659
Only there can it be unmade.

1103
01:41:50,860 --> 01:41:53,559
It must be taken deep into Mordor...

1104
01:41:53,560 --> 01:41:58,059
...and cast back into the fiery
chasm from whence it came.

1105
01:41:58,060 --> 01:42:01,220
<i><font color="#FF0000">[Daghburz]-ishi makha gulshu darulu</font></i>

1106
01:42:01,250 --> 01:42:03,049
One of you...

1107
01:42:03,050 --> 01:42:06,650
...must do this.

1108
01:42:08,150 --> 01:42:12,749
One does not simply walk into Mordor.

1109
01:42:12,750 --> 01:42:17,139
Its black gates are guarded by more than just orcs.

1110
01:42:17,140 --> 01:42:21,539
There is evil there that does not sleep.

1111
01:42:21,540 --> 01:42:26,529
The great eye is ever-watchful.

1112
01:42:26,530 --> 01:42:28,829
It is a barren wasteland...

1113
01:42:28,830 --> 01:42:32,529
...riddled with fire, and ash and dust.

1114
01:42:32,530 --> 01:42:36,629
The very air you breathe is a poisonous fume.

1115
01:42:36,630 --> 01:42:41,129
Not with 10,000 men could you do this.
It is folly.

1116
01:42:41,130 --> 01:42:45,819
Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond has said?
The ring must be destroyed.

1117
01:42:45,820 --> 01:42:48,519
And I suppose you think you are the one to do it!

1118
01:42:48,520 --> 01:42:53,419
And if we fail, what then? What happens
when Sauron takes back what is his?

1119
01:42:53,420 --> 01:43:00,020
I will be dead before I see the
ring in the hands of an elf!

1120
01:43:00,710 --> 01:43:04,409
Never trust an elf!

1121
01:43:04,410 --> 01:43:10,509
Do you not understand? While you bicker
amongst yourselves, Sauron's power grows!

1122
01:43:10,510 --> 01:43:14,399
None can escape it!
You'll all be destroyed!

...I do not know the way.

1135
01:44:04,070 --> 01:44:08,559
I will help you bear this burden, Frodo Baggins...

...as long as it is yours to bear.

1137

If by my life or death I can protect you...

1138

...I will.

1139
01:44:21,460 --> 01:44:25,160
You have my sword.

And you have my bow.

And my ax.

1142
01:44:37,740 --> 01:44:42,040
You carry the fates of us all, little one.

1143
01:44:42,740 --> 01:44:46,939
If this is indeed the will of the Council...

1144
01:44:46,940 --> 01:44:50,840
...then Gondor will see it done.

1145
01:44:51,940 --> 01:44:56,929
- Mr. Frodo's not going anywhere without me.
- No indeed it is hardly possible to separate you...

1146
01:44:56,930 --> 01:45:02,329
...even when he is summoned to a
secret council and you are not.

1147
01:45:02,330 --> 01:45:05,630
Oy. We're coming too!

1148
01:45:06,320 --> 01:45:09,219
You'll have to send us home
tied up in a sack to stop us.

1149
01:45:09,220 --> 01:45:12,919
Anyway, you need people
of intelligence on this sort of...

...mission.

1151

Thing.

01:48:52,680 --> 01:48:57,279
May the blessings of elves and men...

1194
01:48:57,280 --> 01:49:01,280
...and all free folk go with you.

1195
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:08,280
The fellowship awaits the ring-bearer.

1196
01:49:25,480 --> 01:49:28,479
Mordor, Gandalf, is it left or right?

1197
01:49:28,600 --> 01:49:36,200

<i><font color="#FFFF00">(I will sing to you)</font></i>

1198
01:49:28,620 --> 01:49:31,780
Left.

1200
01:50:49,990 --> 01:50:54,589
We must hold to this course, west
of the Misty Mountains, for 40 days.

1201
01:50:54,590 --> 01:50:58,589
If our luck holds, the Gap of Rohan
will still be open to us.

1202
01:50:58,590 --> 01:51:02,289
From there, our road turns east to Mordor.

1203
01:51:02,290 --> 01:51:07,490
Two, one, five. Good! Very good.

1204
01:51:07,990 --> 01:51:09,189
Move your feet.

1205
01:51:09,190 --> 01:51:10,789
- You look good, Pippin.
- Thanks.

1206
01:51:10,790 --> 01:51:13,489
Faster!

1207
01:51:13,490 --> 01:51:17,489
If anyone was to ask for my opinion,
which I note they're not...

1208
01:51:17,490 --> 01:51:20,789
...I'd say we were taking the long way 'round.

1209
01:51:20,790 --> 01:51:24,389
Gandalf.
We could pass through the mines of Moria.

1210
01:51:24,390 --> 01:51:28,489
My cousin Balin would give us a royal welcome.

1211
01:51:28,490 --> 01:51:35,190
No Gimli, I would not take the road through
Moria unless I had no other choice.

1212
01:51:43,200 --> 01:51:44,989
Sorry!

1213
01:51:44,990 --> 01:51:47,990
Get him!

1214
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,999
- For the Shire!
- Hold him. Hold him down, Merry!

1215
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:54,700
Gentlemen, that's enough.

1216
01:51:57,100 --> 01:51:59,099
You've got my arm!
You've got my arm!

1217
01:51:59,100 --> 01:52:02,099
- What is that?
- Nothing. It's just a wisp of cloud.

1218
01:52:02,100 --> 01:52:04,999
It's moving fast.

1219
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,899
Against the wind.

1220
01:52:07,900 --> 01:52:10,299
- Crebain from Dunland!
- Hide!

1221
01:52:10,300 --> 01:52:14,400
- Hurry!
- Take cover!

1222
01:52:46,500 --> 01:52:48,899
Spies of Saruman.

1223
01:52:48,900 --> 01:52:53,299
The passage south is being watched.

1224
01:52:53,300 --> 01:52:58,100
We must take the pass of Caradhras.

1225
01:53:09,200 --> 01:53:12,300
Frodo!

1226

Boromir.

1228
01:53:32,400 --> 01:53:36,809
It is a strange fate that we should
suffer so much fear and doubt...

1229
01:53:36,810 --> 01:53:41,310
...over so small a thing.

1231
01:53:43,210 --> 01:53:45,409
Such a little thing.

1232
01:53:45,410 --> 01:53:47,509
Boromir!

1233
01:53:47,510 --> 01:53:51,510
Give the ring to Frodo.

1234
01:54:00,010 --> 01:54:02,709
As you wish.

1235
01:54:02,710 --> 01:54:06,210
I care not.

1236
01:54:40,110 --> 01:54:45,009
So, Gandalf, you try to lead them over Caradhras.

1237
01:54:45,010 --> 01:54:51,010
And if that fails, where then will you go?

1238
01:54:51,010 --> 01:54:54,109
If the mountain defeats you...

1239
01:54:54,110 --> 01:54:59,910
... will you risk a more dangerous road?

It's Saruman!

1244
01:55:25,420 --> 01:55:30,219
He's trying to bring down the mountain!
Gandalf, we must turn back!

1245
01:55:30,220 --> 01:55:33,520
No!

1250
01:56:38,520 --> 01:56:40,819
We must get off the mountain!

1251
01:56:40,820 --> 01:56:45,419
Make for the Gap of Rohan,
and take the west road to my city!

1252
01:56:45,420 --> 01:56:48,919
The Gap of Rohan takes us too close to Isengard!

1253
01:56:48,920 --> 01:56:52,919
We cannot pass over a mountain.
Let us go under it.

1254
01:56:52,920 --> 01:56:57,120
Let us go through the mines of Moria.

1255
01:56:57,520 --> 01:57:02,019
Moria. You fear to go into those mines.

1256
01:57:02,020 --> 01:57:07,919
The dwarves delved too greedily and too deep.

1257
01:57:07,920 --> 01:57:14,019
You know what they awoke
in the darkness of Khazad-dûm:

1258
01:57:14,020 --> 01:57:18,820
Shadow and flame.

1259
01:57:20,920 --> 01:57:25,020
Let the ring-bearer decide.

1260
01:57:28,330 --> 01:57:30,629
We cannot stay here!

1261
01:57:30,630 --> 01:57:33,629
This will be the death of the hobbits.

1262
01:57:33,630 --> 01:57:36,730
Frodo?

1263
01:57:38,330 --> 01:57:42,029
We will go through the mines.

1264
01:57:42,030 --> 01:57:45,330
So be it.

1265
01:57:50,530 --> 01:57:55,730
Frodo, come and help an old man.

1266
01:57:57,930 --> 01:58:00,329
How is your shoulder?

1267
01:58:00,330 --> 01:58:04,930
- Better than it was.
- And the ring?

1268
01:58:05,130 --> 01:58:08,129
You feel its power growing, don't you?

1269
01:58:08,130 --> 01:58:11,529
I've felt it too.
You must be careful now.

1270
01:58:11,530 --> 01:58:15,529
Evil will be drawn to you from
outside the fellowship.

1271
01:58:15,530 --> 01:58:19,530
And, I fear, from within.

1272
01:58:20,830 --> 01:58:25,129
- Who then do I trust?
- You must trust yourself.

1273
01:58:25,130 --> 01:58:28,229
Trust your own strengths.

1274
01:58:28,230 --> 01:58:30,929
- What do you mean?
- There are many powers in this world...

1275
01:58:30,930 --> 01:58:33,229
...for good or for evil.

1276
01:58:33,230 --> 01:58:36,029
Some are greater than I am.

1277
01:58:36,030 --> 01:58:40,930
And against some I have not yet been tested.

1278
01:58:41,030 --> 01:58:43,129
The walls...

1279
01:58:43,130 --> 01:58:46,630
...of Moria.

1280
01:58:50,930 --> 01:58:54,129
Dwarf doors are invisible when closed.

1281
01:58:54,130 --> 01:58:58,929
Yes, Gimli, their own masters cannot find
them if their secrets are forgotten.

1282
01:58:58,930 --> 01:59:02,830
Why doesn't that surprise me?

1283
01:59:09,330 --> 01:59:12,929
Well, let's see.

It reads; "The Doors of Durin, Lord of Moria.

1288
01:59:37,140 --> 01:59:41,900

- What do you suppose that means?

you speak the password and the doors will open.

I once knew every spell in

...men and orcs.

1297
02:00:26,140 --> 02:00:27,539
What are you going to do, then?

1298
02:00:27,540 --> 02:00:30,039
Knock your head against these doors,
Peregrin Took!

1299

And if that does not shatter them...

1300

peace from foolish questions...

Do not disturb the water.

1311

Oh, it's useless.

1312
02:01:30,550 --> 02:01:34,150
It's a riddle.

"Speak 'friend' and enter."

1314
02:01:39,050 --> 02:01:43,249
What's the elvish word for "friend"?

Roaring fires, malt beer, ripe meat off the bone!

1318
02:02:15,250 --> 02:02:18,749
This, my friend, is the home of my cousin Balin.

1319
02:02:18,750 --> 02:02:21,249
And they call it a mine.

1320
02:02:21,250 --> 02:02:24,349
A mine!

1321
02:02:24,350 --> 02:02:28,950
This is no mine. It's a tomb.

1322
02:02:33,750 --> 02:02:36,559
No....

1323
02:02:36,560 --> 02:02:39,660
No!

1324
02:02:40,950 --> 02:02:43,850
Goblins.

1325
02:02:46,350 --> 02:02:51,649
We make for the Gap of Rohan.
We should never have come here.

1326
02:02:51,650 --> 02:02:55,650
Now, get out of here. Get out!

1327
02:02:57,050 --> 02:02:59,759
- Frodo!
- Help!

1328
02:02:59,760 --> 02:03:01,459
Strider!

1329
02:03:01,460 --> 02:03:04,359
- Help!
- Get off him!

Frodo!

1332
02:03:43,160 --> 02:03:44,459
Into the mines!

1333
02:03:44,460 --> 02:03:49,060
- Legolas!
- Into the cave!

1334
02:03:51,960 --> 02:03:55,160
Run!

1335
02:04:10,660 --> 02:04:14,459
We now have but one choice.

1336
02:04:14,460 --> 02:04:19,559
We must face the long dark of Moria.

1337
02:04:19,560 --> 02:04:21,759
Be on your guard.

1338
02:04:21,760 --> 02:04:25,459
There are older and fouler things than orcs...

1339
02:04:25,460 --> 02:04:30,260
...in the deep places of the world.

1340
02:04:36,860 --> 02:04:41,069
Quietly now.
It's a four-day journey to the other side.

The wealth of Moria was not in gold...

1347
02:05:34,570 --> 02:05:37,069
...or jewels...

1348
02:05:37,070 --> 02:05:41,570

Bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings
that Thorin gave him.

1351
02:06:03,670 --> 02:06:07,669
- Oh, that was a kingly gift.
- Yes.

1352
02:06:07,670 --> 02:06:09,869
I never told him...

1353
02:06:09,870 --> 02:06:16,070
...but its worth was greater
than the value of the Shire.

I have no memory of this place.

1359
02:06:54,180 --> 02:06:55,879
- Are we Lost?
- No.

1360
02:06:55,880 --> 02:06:58,579
- I think we are.
- Gandalf's thinking.

1361
02:06:58,580 --> 02:07:00,279
- Merry?
- What?

1362
02:07:00,280 --> 02:07:03,580
I'm hungry.

1363
02:07:13,580 --> 02:07:18,179
- There's something down there.
- It's Gollum.

1364
02:07:18,180 --> 02:07:22,579
- Gollum?
- He's been following us for three days.

1365
02:07:22,580 --> 02:07:27,379
- He escaped the dungeons of Barad-dûr?
- Escaped...

1366
02:07:27,380 --> 02:07:29,579
...or was set loose.

1367
02:07:29,580 --> 02:07:34,580
Now the ring has brought him here.

1368
02:07:35,780 --> 02:07:38,879
He will never be rid of his need for it.

1369
02:07:38,880 --> 02:07:44,679
He hates and loves the ring,
as he hates and loves himseIf.

1370
02:07:44,680 --> 02:07:49,779
Smeagol's life is a sad story.

1371
02:07:49,780 --> 02:07:56,679
Yes, Smeagol he was once called.
Before the ring found him.

1372
02:07:56,680 --> 02:07:59,679
Before it drove him mad.

1373
02:07:59,680 --> 02:08:02,779
It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him
when he had the chance.

1374
02:08:02,780 --> 02:08:04,979
Pity?

1375
02:08:04,980 --> 02:08:08,879
It is pity that stayed Bilbo's hand.

1376
02:08:08,880 --> 02:08:15,380
Many that live deserve death.
Some that die deserve life.

1377
02:08:15,580 --> 02:08:19,480
Can you give it to them, Frodo?

1378
02:08:20,480 --> 02:08:24,589
Do not be too eager to deal
out death and judgment.

1379
02:08:24,590 --> 02:08:28,079
Even the very wise cannot see all ends.

1380
02:08:28,080 --> 02:08:34,879
My heart tells me that Gollum has some
part to play yet, for good or ill...

1381
02:08:34,880 --> 02:08:39,080
...before this is over.

1382
02:08:39,180 --> 02:08:44,380
The pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many.

1383
02:08:49,790 --> 02:08:54,490
I wish the ring had never come to me.

1384
02:08:54,490 --> 02:08:56,679
I wish none of this had happened.

1385
02:08:56,680 --> 02:09:02,589
So do all who live to see such times.
But that is not for them to decide.

1386
02:09:02,590 --> 02:09:09,390
All we have to decide is what to do
with the time that is given to us.

1387
02:09:09,590 --> 02:09:13,989
There are other forces at work in this
world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.

1388
02:09:13,990 --> 02:09:16,889
Bilbo was meant to find the ring.

1389
02:09:16,890 --> 02:09:21,489
In which case, you also were meant to have it.

1390
02:09:21,490 --> 02:09:25,990
And that is an encouraging thought.

1391
02:09:29,490 --> 02:09:31,689
It's that way.

1392
02:09:31,690 --> 02:09:34,189
- He's remembered.
- No.

1393
02:09:34,190 --> 02:09:38,089
But the air doesn't smell so foul down here.

1394
02:09:38,090 --> 02:09:44,590
If in doubt, Meriadoc, always follow your nose.

1395
02:09:58,190 --> 02:10:03,690
Let me risk a little more light.

1396
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:09,489
Behold...

1397
02:10:09,490 --> 02:10:16,090
...the great realm and dwarf-city of Dwarrowdelf.

1398
02:10:17,190 --> 02:10:21,990
Now there's an eye opener, and no mistake.

1399
02:10:45,600 --> 02:10:48,800
Gimli!

1400
02:10:54,700 --> 02:10:57,800
No!

1401
02:10:58,900 --> 02:11:03,500
Oh, no.

1402
02:11:03,900 --> 02:11:06,600
No.

1403
02:11:12,500 --> 02:11:14,899
"Here lies Balin...

1404
02:11:14,900 --> 02:11:17,299
...son of Fundin...

1405
02:11:17,300 --> 02:11:20,899
...Lord of Moria."

1406
02:11:20,900 --> 02:11:24,000
He is dead, then.

1407
02:11:24,400 --> 02:11:27,500
It's as I feared.

1408
02:11:44,300 --> 02:11:47,399
We must move on. We cannot linger.

1409
02:11:47,400 --> 02:11:53,199
"They have taken the bridge and the second hall.

1410
02:11:53,200 --> 02:11:56,399
We have barred the gates...

1411
02:11:56,400 --> 02:11:59,099
...but cannot hold them for long.

1412
02:11:59,100 --> 02:12:02,399
The ground shakes.

1413
02:12:02,400 --> 02:12:04,299
Drums...

1414
02:12:04,300 --> 02:12:09,000
...drums in the deep.

1415
02:12:11,300 --> 02:12:14,700
We cannot get out.

1416
02:12:15,300 --> 02:12:20,500
A shadow moves in the dark.

1417
02:12:20,800 --> 02:12:24,800
We cannot get out.

1418
02:12:26,410 --> 02:12:29,710
They are coming."

1419
02:13:11,410 --> 02:13:13,509
Fool of a Took!

1420
02:13:13,510 --> 02:13:18,710
Throw yourself in next time,
and rid us of your stupidity.

1421
02:13:43,410 --> 02:13:46,510
Frodo!

1422
02:13:47,410 --> 02:13:50,310
Orcs.

1423
02:13:55,910 --> 02:13:59,310
Get back! Stay close to Gandalf!

1424
02:14:05,120 --> 02:14:08,320
They have a cave-troll.

1425
02:14:22,610 --> 02:14:24,219
Let them come!

1426
02:14:24,220 --> 02:14:29,120
There is one dwarf yet in Moria
who still draws breath.

1427
02:16:46,730 --> 02:16:50,930
I think I'm getting the hang of this.

1428
02:16:54,230 --> 02:16:57,430
Frodo!

1429
02:17:29,430 --> 02:17:32,329

1430
02:17:32,330 --> 02:17:35,630

02:18:19,340 --> 02:18:22,740
Frodo!

1432
02:19:21,540 --> 02:19:24,340
Oh, no.

1433
02:19:31,240 --> 02:19:34,540
He's alive.

1434
02:19:35,640 --> 02:19:38,739
I'm all right. I'm not hurt.

1435
02:19:38,740 --> 02:19:41,239
You should be dead.

1436
02:19:41,240 --> 02:19:43,839
That spear would have skewered a wild boar.

1437
02:19:43,840 --> 02:19:49,940
I think there's more to this
hobbit than meets the eye.

1438
02:19:54,450 --> 02:19:57,050
Mithril.

1439
02:19:58,350 --> 02:20:02,350
You are full of surprises, Master Baggins.

1440
02:20:06,850 --> 02:20:10,150
To the bridge of Khazad-dûm!

1441

Gandalf!

1483
02:26:16,480 --> 02:26:22,279
I am a servant of the secret fire,
wielder of the flame of Anor.

1484
02:26:22,280 --> 02:26:27,480
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udûn!

1485
02:26:36,180 --> 02:26:39,580
Go back to the Shadow.

1486

You - shall not - pass!

1487

- No! No!
- Gandalf!

1488

1489
02:27:35,590 --> 02:27:39,190
No!

Legolas, get them up.

1492

Give them a moment, for pity's sake!

1493
02:28:52,390 --> 02:28:56,289
By nightfall, these hills will be swarming with orcs.

1494
02:28:56,290 --> 02:29:00,489
We must reach the woods of Lothlórien.

1495

Come, Boromir. Legolas.
Gimli, get them up.

Nor would he have you give up hope.

You carry a heavy burden, Frodo.

Don't carry the weight of the dead.

Eight there are here, yet nine there
were set out from Rivendell.

1553
02:34:56,030 --> 02:34:58,029
Tell me, where is Gandalf?

1554

For I much desire to speak with him.

I can no longer see him from afar.

1556

Gandalf the Grey did not pass
the borders of this land.

1557
02:35:10,430 --> 02:35:14,230
He has fallen into shadow.

1558

He was taken by both shadow and flame.

1559

A Balrog of Morgoth.

1560
02:35:28,130 --> 02:35:32,930
For we went needlessly into the net of Moria.

Needless were none of the deeds of Gandalf in life.

We do not yet know his full purpose.

of Khazad-dûm fill your heart...

...Gimli, son of Gloin.

1565
02:35:53,330 --> 02:35:58,230
For the world has grown full of peril...

...and in all lands...

1567

...love is now mingled with grief.

What now becomes of this fellowship?

1569
02:36:20,730 --> 02:36:25,030
Without Gandalf, hope is lost.

1570
02:36:26,630 --> 02:36:30,029
The quest stands upon the edge of a knife.

1571
02:36:30,030 --> 02:36:33,929
Stray but a little and it will fail...

1572

...to the ruin of all.

1573
02:36:41,130 --> 02:36:48,130
Yet hope remains while the company is true.

Do not let your hearts be troubled.
Go now and rest...

02:39:10,550 --> 02:39:14,250
But his rule is failing...

1617
02:39:15,950 --> 02:39:19,850
...and our people lose faith.

1618
02:39:19,950 --> 02:39:23,649
He looks to me to make things right,
and I would do it.

1619
02:39:23,650 --> 02:39:28,550
I would see the glory of Gondor restored.

1620
02:39:30,050 --> 02:39:33,649
Have you ever seen it, Aragorn?

1621
02:39:33,650 --> 02:39:35,949
The white tower of Ecthelion.

1622
02:39:35,950 --> 02:39:40,349
Glimmering like a spike of pearl and silver.

1623
02:39:40,350 --> 02:39:45,250
Its banners caught high in the morning breeze.

1624
02:39:46,850 --> 02:39:48,949
Have you ever been called home...

1625
02:39:48,950 --> 02:39:53,549
...by the clear ringing of silver trumpets?

1626
02:39:53,550 --> 02:39:57,049
I have seen the white city...

1627
02:39:57,050 --> 02:39:59,549
...long ago.

1628
02:39:59,550 --> 02:40:05,449
One day, our paths will lead us there.

1629
02:40:05,450 --> 02:40:08,949
And the tower guard shall take up the call:

1630
02:40:08,950 --> 02:40:13,550
"The Lords of Gondor have returned."

<i>If you ask it of me...</i>

1654
02:43:51,770 --> 02:43:55,969
<i>... I will give you the one ring.</i>

1655
02:43:55,970 --> 02:43:59,570

...not dark but beautiful and terrible as the dawn!

1659

Treacherous as the sea!

1660
02:44:24,580 --> 02:44:30,079
Stronger than the foundations of the earth!

1661

...and despair.

1663
02:44:49,580 --> 02:44:54,179
I pass the test. I will diminish...

1664
02:44:54,180 --> 02:44:56,879
...and go into the West...

1665
02:44:56,880 --> 02:45:02,680
...and remain Galadriel.
- I cannot do this alone.

1666
02:45:04,880 --> 02:45:09,979
You are a ring-bearer, Frodo.
To bear a ring of power...

1667
02:45:09,980 --> 02:45:12,880
...is to be alone.

1668
02:45:14,880 --> 02:45:17,879
This is Nenya, the ring of Adamant.

1669
02:45:17,880 --> 02:45:20,880
And I am its keeper.

1670
02:45:22,680 --> 02:45:27,379
This task was appointed to you.

1671
02:45:27,380 --> 02:45:31,479
And if you do not find a way...

1672
02:45:31,480 --> 02:45:33,879
...no one will.

1673
02:45:33,880 --> 02:45:37,579
Then I know what I must do.

1674
02:45:37,580 --> 02:45:40,280
It's just...

1675
02:45:42,080 --> 02:45:45,780
...I'm afraid to do it.

1676
02:45:47,780 --> 02:45:54,280
Even the smallest person can change
the course of the future.

1677
02:45:58,380 --> 02:46:04,889
Do you know how the orcs first came into being?

1678
02:46:04,890 --> 02:46:09,279
They were elves once.

1679
02:46:09,280 --> 02:46:12,979
Taken by the dark powers...

1680
02:46:12,980 --> 02:46:16,379
...tortured and mutilated.

1681
02:46:16,380 --> 02:46:21,889
A ruined and terrible form of life.

1682
02:46:21,890 --> 02:46:25,190
And now...

1683
02:46:25,290 --> 02:46:27,889
...perfected.

1684
02:46:27,890 --> 02:46:32,390
My fighting Uruk-hai...

1685
02:46:32,990 --> 02:46:35,489
...whom do you serve?

1686
02:46:35,490 --> 02:46:39,390
Saruman!

1687
02:46:58,790 --> 02:47:02,489
Hunt them down. Do not stop until, they are found.

1688
02:47:02,490 --> 02:47:05,589
You do not know pain.
You do not know fear.

1689
02:47:05,590 --> 02:47:09,890
You will taste man-flesh!

1690
02:47:13,590 --> 02:47:17,489
One of the halflings carries
something of great value.

1691
02:47:17,490 --> 02:47:22,990
Bring them to me alive and unspoiled.

1692
02:47:23,590 --> 02:47:26,290
Kill the others.

Elvish waybread.

1699

One small bite is enough to fill
the stomach of a grown man.

1701

Four.

Every league you travel south,

Mordor orcs now hold the
eastern shore of the Anduin.

Nor will you find safety on the western bank.

Strange creatures bearing the mark of the
white hand have been seen on our borders.

Gollum. He has tracked us since Moria.

1758
02:54:47,130 --> 02:54:50,429
I had hoped we would lose him on the river.

1759
02:54:50,430 --> 02:54:54,429
But he's too clever a waterman.

1760
02:54:54,430 --> 02:54:57,829
And if he alerts the enemy to our whereabouts...

1761
02:54:57,830 --> 02:55:00,229
...it will make the crossing even more dangerous.

1762
02:55:00,230 --> 02:55:02,529
Have some food, Mr. Frodo.

1763
02:55:02,530 --> 02:55:05,929
- No, Sam.
- You haven't eaten anything all day.

1764
02:55:05,930 --> 02:55:09,829
You're not sleeping, neither.
Don't think I haven't noticed.

1765
02:55:09,830 --> 02:55:13,029
- Mr. Frodo
- I'm all right.

1766
02:55:13,030 --> 02:55:14,529
But you're not.

1767
02:55:14,530 --> 02:55:17,229
I'm here to help you.

1768
02:55:17,230 --> 02:55:20,330
I promised Gandalf that I would.

1769
02:55:24,940 --> 02:55:28,940
You can't help me, Sam.

1770
02:55:29,840 --> 02:55:32,940
Not this time.

1771
02:55:34,430 --> 02:55:37,930
Get some sleep.

1772
02:55:42,840 --> 02:55:45,539
Minas Tirith is the safer road.

1773
02:55:45,540 --> 02:55:48,939
You know that.
From there we can regroup.

1774
02:55:48,940 --> 02:55:51,439
Strike out for Mordor from a place of strength.

1775
02:55:51,440 --> 02:55:54,839
There is no strength in Gondor that can avail us.

1776
02:55:54,840 --> 02:55:58,240
You were quick enough to trust the elves.

1777
02:55:58,640 --> 02:56:01,639
Have you so little faith in your own people?

1778
02:56:01,640 --> 02:56:04,839
Yes, there is weakness.
There is frailty.

1779
02:56:04,840 --> 02:56:08,339
But there is courage also,
and honor to be found in men.

1780
02:56:08,340 --> 02:56:10,939
But you will not see that.

1781
02:56:10,940 --> 02:56:12,639
You are afraid!

1782
02:56:12,640 --> 02:56:15,439
All your life, you have hidden in the shadows.

1783
02:56:15,440 --> 02:56:20,240
Scared of who you are, of what you are.

1784
02:56:21,340 --> 02:56:27,040
I will not lead the ring within
a hundred leagues of your city.

1785
02:56:37,540 --> 02:56:40,340
Frodo.

1786
02:56:40,740 --> 02:56:43,640
The Argonath.

1787
02:56:43,970 --> 02:56:59,459

1788
02:56:45,740 --> 02:56:50,139
Long have I desired to look upon the kings of old.

1789
02:56:50,140 --> 02:56:53,440
My kin.

1791
02:58:11,150 --> 02:58:13,549
We cross the lake at nightfall.

1792
02:58:13,550 --> 02:58:16,249
Hide the boats and continue on foot.

1793
02:58:16,250 --> 02:58:20,149
- We approach Mordor from the North.
- Oh, yes?

1794
02:58:20,150 --> 02:58:24,149
Just a simple matter of finding
our way through Emyn Muil...

1795
02:58:24,150 --> 02:58:27,549
...an impassable labyrinth of razor-sharp rocks.

1796
02:58:27,550 --> 02:58:31,049
And after that, it gets even better.

1797
02:58:31,050 --> 02:58:36,249
Festering, stinking marshland
as far as the eye can see.

1798
02:58:36,250 --> 02:58:39,050
That is our road.

1799
02:58:39,150 --> 02:58:42,549
I suggest you take some rest and
recover your strength, Master Dwarf.

1800
02:58:42,550 --> 02:58:45,650
Recover my...

1801
02:58:47,350 --> 02:58:49,449
- We should Leave now.
- No.

1802
02:58:49,450 --> 02:58:54,049
Orcs patrol the eastern shore.
We must wait for cover of darkness.

1803
02:58:54,050 --> 02:58:57,749
It is not the eastern shore that worries me.

1804
02:58:57,750 --> 02:59:02,249
A shadow and a threat has
been growing in my mind.

1805
02:59:02,250 --> 02:59:07,750
Something draws near.
I can feel it.

1806
02:59:08,450 --> 02:59:13,949
Recover strength?
Pay no heed to that, young hobbit.

1807
02:59:13,950 --> 02:59:17,050
Where's Frodo?

1808
02:59:41,260 --> 02:59:44,459
None of us should wander alone.

1809
02:59:44,460 --> 02:59:46,859
You, least of all.

1810
02:59:46,860 --> 02:59:50,359
So much depends on you.

1811
02:59:50,360 --> 02:59:53,760
Frodo?

1812
02:59:59,460 --> 03:00:02,759
I know why you seek solitude.

1813
03:00:02,760 --> 03:00:06,959
You suffer. I see it day by day.

1814
03:00:06,960 --> 03:00:11,460
You sure you do not suffer needlessly?

1815
03:00:11,660 --> 03:00:14,559
There are other ways, Frodo.

1816
03:00:14,560 --> 03:00:18,559
- Other paths that we might take.
- I know what you would say.

1817
03:00:18,560 --> 03:00:22,559
It would seem like wisdom but
for the warning in my heart.

1818
03:00:22,560 --> 03:00:25,859
Warning...against what?

1819
03:00:25,860 --> 03:00:28,159
We're all afraid, Frodo.

1820
03:00:28,160 --> 03:00:32,059
But to let that fear drive us,
to destroy what hope we have...

1821
03:00:32,060 --> 03:00:37,160
...don't you see that is madness?
- There is no other way.

1822
03:00:37,660 --> 03:00:42,260
I ask only for the strength to defend my people!

1823
03:00:42,560 --> 03:00:45,759
- If you would but lend me the ring.
- No.

1824
03:00:45,760 --> 03:00:50,760
- Why do you recoil? I am no thief.
- You are not yourself.

1825
03:00:51,360 --> 03:00:54,769
What chance do you think you have?

1826
03:00:54,770 --> 03:00:59,659
They will find you.
They will take the ring.

1827
03:00:59,660 --> 03:01:04,760
And you will beg for death before the end!

It is not yours, save by unhappy chance!
It could have been mine.

1831
03:01:11,960 --> 03:01:14,900

1837
03:01:28,270 --> 03:01:31,369
You will take the ring to Sauron!

1838
03:01:31,370 --> 03:01:33,469
You will betray us!

1839
03:01:33,470 --> 03:01:37,069
You'll go to your death, and the death of us all!

Curse you!
Curse you and all the halflings!

1841
03:01:47,770 --> 03:01:50,770
Frodo?

03:01:53,570 --> 03:01:56,670
Frodo.

1843
03:01:59,170 --> 03:02:01,369
What have I done?

1844
03:02:01,370 --> 03:02:03,369
Please, Frodo.

- It has taken Boromir.

1851
03:03:06,570 --> 03:03:11,770

I let Frodo go.

Then you did what I could not.

1894

I tried to take the ring from him.

I did not see it.

- No, Boromir.

1898
03:12:11,520 --> 03:12:14,319
You fought bravely.

You have kept your honor.

1900
03:12:17,620 --> 03:12:19,819
Leave it.

It is over.

all will come to darkness...

...but I swear to you, I will
not let the white city fall...

1906
03:12:43,730 --> 03:12:47,129
...nor our people fail.

1907
03:12:47,130 --> 03:12:50,030
Our people.

1908
03:12:52,430 --> 03:12:55,930
Our people.

1909
03:13:16,230 --> 03:13:20,630
I would have followed you, my brother.

1910
03:13:20,830 --> 03:13:24,230
My captain.

1911
03:13:25,530 --> 03:13:28,830
My king.

1912

1913
03:13:47,030 --> 03:13:49,729
Be at peace...

1914
03:13:49,730 --> 03:13:53,030
...son of Gondor.

1915
03:14:08,030 --> 03:14:11,929
They will look for his coming from the white tower.

1916
03:14:11,930 --> 03:14:16,330
But he will not return.

1917
03:14:38,240 --> 03:14:41,640
Frodo!

1918
03:14:59,640 --> 03:15:04,139
I wish the ring had never come to me.

1919
03:15:04,140 --> 03:15:08,440
I wish none of this had happened.

1920
03:15:10,140 --> 03:15:13,139
So do all who live to see such times...

1921
03:15:13,140 --> 03:15:16,839
...but that is not for them to decide.

1922
03:15:16,840 --> 03:15:19,639
All you have to decide...

1923
03:15:19,640 --> 03:15:25,740
...is what to do with the time that is given to you.

1924
03:15:53,140 --> 03:15:55,939
Frodo, no!

1925
03:15:55,940 --> 03:15:57,849
Frodo!

1926
03:15:57,850 --> 03:16:01,950
- Mr. Frodo!
- No, Sam.

1927
03:16:04,140 --> 03:16:06,639
Go back, Sam!

1928
03:16:06,640 --> 03:16:10,339
- I'm going to Mordor alone.
- Of course you are.

1929
03:16:10,340 --> 03:16:13,739
And I'm coming with you!

1930
03:16:13,740 --> 03:16:17,540
You can't swim!

1931
03:16:19,840 --> 03:16:23,040
Sam!

1932
03:16:27,150 --> 03:16:30,050
Sam!

1933
03:17:09,450 --> 03:17:12,549
I made a promise, Mr. Frodo.

1934
03:17:12,550 --> 03:17:17,949
A promise:
"Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee."

1935
03:17:17,950 --> 03:17:20,849
And I don't mean to.

1936
03:17:20,850 --> 03:17:24,450
I don't mean to.

1937
03:17:24,750 --> 03:17:27,950
Oh Sam.

1938
03:17:41,450 --> 03:17:44,550
Come on.

1939
03:18:11,450 --> 03:18:17,350
Hurry! Frodo and Sam have
reached the eastern shore.

1940
03:18:30,960 --> 03:18:37,360
- You mean not to follow them.
- Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.

1941
03:18:39,360 --> 03:18:45,560
Then it has all been in vain.
The fellowship has failed.

1942
03:18:56,060 --> 03:19:00,660
Not if we hold true to each other.

1943
03:19:00,660 --> 03:19:06,059
We will not abandon Merry and
Pippin to torment and death.

1944
03:19:06,060 --> 03:19:12,660
Not while we have strength left.
Leave all that can be spared behind.

1945
03:19:12,660 --> 03:19:14,859
We travel light.

1946
03:19:14,860 --> 03:19:18,260
Let us hunt some orc.

1947
03:19:19,760 --> 03:19:23,260
Yes!

1948
03:19:40,760 --> 03:19:42,859
Mordor.

1949
03:19:42,860 --> 03:19:47,159
I hope the others find a safer road.

1950
03:19:47,160 --> 03:19:50,769
Strider will look after them.

1951
03:19:50,770 --> 03:19:54,459
I don't suppose we'll ever see them again.

1952
03:19:54,460 --> 03:19:56,969
We may yet, Mr. Frodo.

1953
03:19:56,970 --> 03:19:59,970
We may.

1954
03:20:00,670 --> 03:20:03,270
Sam...

1955
03:20:05,370 --> 03:20:09,370
...I'm glad you are with me.
