Gandalf!

25
00:03:53,376 --> 00:03:55,482
What is it, Mr. Frodo?

26
00:03:57,547 --> 00:03:59,238
Nothing.

27
00:04:06,523 --> 00:04:08,497
Just a dream.

28
00:04:21,738 --> 00:04:23,014
Can you see the bottom?

29
00:04:24,309 --> 00:04:27,275
No! Don't look down, Sam!
Just keep going!

30
00:04:38,257 --> 00:04:40,296
Catch it! Grab it, Mr. Frodo!

31
00:04:43,461 --> 00:04:45,347
Mr. Frodo!

32
00:04:48,099 --> 00:04:49,659
I think I've found the bottom.

33
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,109
Bogs and rope,
and goodness knows what.

34
00:04:58,376 --> 00:05:01,441
It's not natural. None of it.

35
00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:06,624
- What's in this?
- Nothing.

36
00:05:08,153 --> 00:05:09,200
Just a bit of seasoning.

37
00:05:09,721 --> 00:05:12,438
I thought maybe if we was having
a roast chicken one night or something.

38
00:05:13,192 --> 00:05:15,264
Roast chicken?!

39
00:05:16,027 --> 00:05:17,205
You never know.

40
00:05:17,662 --> 00:05:20,476
Sam. My dear Sam.

41
00:05:22,369 --> 00:05:26,143
It's very special, that.
It's the best salt in all the Shire.

42
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:29,448
It is special.

43
00:05:33,445 --> 00:05:35,267
It's a little bit of home.

44
00:05:38,617 --> 00:05:41,039
We can't leave this here for someone
to follow us down.

45
00:05:41,521 --> 00:05:44,968
Who's gonna follow us down here,
Mr. Frodo?

46
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:49,503
It's a shame, really.
Lady Galadriel gave me that.

47
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:52,284
Real Elvish rope.

48
00:05:53,265 --> 00:05:55,503
Well, there's nothing for it.
It's one of my knots.

49
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:57,656
Won't come free in a hurry.

50
00:06:06,612 --> 00:06:08,816
Real Elvish rope.

51
00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:27,252
Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth
we don't want to see any closer.

52
00:06:27,568 --> 00:06:29,640
And it's the one place
we're trying to get to.

53
00:06:30,538 --> 00:06:32,261
It's just where we can't get.

54
00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:36,555
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.

55
00:06:39,146 --> 00:06:41,829
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to
come this way.

56
00:06:43,485 --> 00:06:46,582
He didn't mean for a lot of things
to happen, Sam...

57
00:06:47,588 --> 00:06:49,083
...but they did.

58
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,131
Mr. Frodo?

59
00:07:07,141 --> 00:07:08,418
It's the Ring, isn't it?

60
00:07:09,578 --> 00:07:11,998
It's getting heavier.

61
00:07:24,659 --> 00:07:27,310
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.

62
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:30,171
Oh, yes. Lovely.

63
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:33,083
Lembas bread. And look!

64
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:37,872
More lembas bread.

65
00:07:48,618 --> 00:07:50,505
I don't usually hold with foreign food...

66
00:07:50,753 --> 00:07:53,600
...but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.

67
00:07:54,624 --> 00:07:58,039
Nothing ever dampens your spirits,
does it, Sam?

68
00:08:04,033 --> 00:08:06,172
Those rain clouds might.

69
00:08:40,538 --> 00:08:43,220
This looks strangely familiar.

70
00:08:43,974 --> 00:08:46,308
It's because we've been here before.

71
00:08:46,577 --> 00:08:49,099
We're going in circles.

72
00:08:49,982 --> 00:08:51,639
What is that horrid stink?

73
00:08:52,015 --> 00:08:54,088
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.

74
00:08:54,319 --> 00:08:56,206
- Can you smell it?
- Yes.

75
00:08:58,322 --> 00:09:00,395
I can smell it.

76
00:09:03,662 --> 00:09:06,083
We're not alone.

77
00:09:19,912 --> 00:09:23,839
The thieves. The thieves.

78
00:09:24,149 --> 00:09:27,945
The filthy little thieves.

79
00:09:28,687 --> 00:09:30,890
Where is it?

80
00:09:31,155 --> 00:09:33,610
Where is it?

81
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:37,526
They stole it from us.

82
00:09:37,964 --> 00:09:41,957
My precious.

83
00:09:43,035 --> 00:09:46,100
Curse them, we hates them!

84
00:09:46,405 --> 00:09:50,300
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!

85
00:10:45,566 --> 00:10:47,322
This is Sting.

86
00:10:47,535 --> 00:10:49,095
You've seen it before...

87
00:10:49,303 --> 00:10:51,637
...haven't you, Gollum?

88
00:10:55,777 --> 00:10:59,191
Release him or I'll cut your throat.

89
00:11:15,364 --> 00:11:17,119
It burns!

90
00:11:17,332 --> 00:11:19,470
It burns us!

91
00:11:21,135 --> 00:11:22,477
It freezes!

92
00:11:24,373 --> 00:11:26,478
Nasty Elves twisted it.

93
00:11:26,743 --> 00:11:29,328
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!

94
00:11:32,981 --> 00:11:37,006
It's hopeless. Every Orc in Mordor's
going to hear this racket.

95
00:11:37,351 --> 00:11:39,872
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!

96
00:11:40,222 --> 00:11:43,518
That would kill us! Kill us!

97
00:11:43,793 --> 00:11:46,410
It's no more than you deserve!

98
00:11:48,264 --> 00:11:50,238
Maybe he does deserve to die.

99
00:11:52,635 --> 00:11:56,049
But now that I see him, I do pity him.

100
00:11:59,575 --> 00:12:04,211
We be nice to them
if they be nice to us.

101
00:12:04,614 --> 00:12:07,297
Take it off us.

102
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:14,317
We swears to do what you wants.

103
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:16,479
We swears.

104
00:12:16,994 --> 00:12:19,262
There's no promise you can make
that I can trust.

105
00:12:22,065 --> 00:12:23,625
We swears...

106
00:12:24,068 --> 00:12:28,508
...to serve the master
of the precious.

107
00:12:30,407 --> 00:12:32,578
We will swear on...

108
00:12:32,977 --> 00:12:34,699
...on the precious.

109
00:12:35,111 --> 00:12:37,184
Gollum. Gollum.

110
00:12:37,414 --> 00:12:41,342
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.

111
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:43,596
Yes...

112
00:12:44,322 --> 00:12:46,624
...on the precious.

113
00:12:49,193 --> 00:12:51,463
On the precious.

114
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,224
I don't believe you!

115
00:12:56,301 --> 00:12:59,562
- Get down! I said, down!
- Sam!

116
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:01,566
He's trying to trick us.

117
00:13:01,774 --> 00:13:04,806
If we let him go, he'll throttle us
in our sleep.

118
00:13:16,288 --> 00:13:20,565
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.

119
00:13:23,695 --> 00:13:25,418
You've been there before?

120
00:13:26,498 --> 00:13:28,090
Yes.

121
00:13:39,078 --> 00:13:41,466
You will lead us to the Black Gate.

122
00:13:50,256 --> 00:13:53,998
To the Gate, to the Gate!
To the Gate, the master says. Yes!

123
00:13:54,293 --> 00:13:58,930
No! We won't go back.
Not there. Not to him.

124
00:13:59,265 --> 00:14:03,291
They can't make us. Gollum! Gollum!

125
00:14:03,604 --> 00:14:06,985
But we swore to serve the master
of the precious.

126
00:14:07,307 --> 00:14:13,023
No. Ashes and dust and thirst there is,
and pits, pits, pits.

127
00:14:13,413 --> 00:14:16,194
And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.

128
00:14:16,448 --> 00:14:21,369
And always the Great Eye watching,
watching.

129
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:28,235
Hey! Come back now! Come back!

130
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:32,999
There! What did I tell you?

131
00:14:33,233 --> 00:14:35,338
He's run off, the old villain.

132
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:38,057
So much for his promises.

133
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:39,932
This way, Hobbits.

134
00:14:40,207 --> 00:14:42,149
Follow me!

135
00:14:56,123 --> 00:14:57,399
Merry!

136
00:14:58,426 --> 00:14:59,920
Merry!

137
00:15:05,433 --> 00:15:09,078
You're late.
Our master grows impatient.

138
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:11,159
He wants the Shire-rats now.

139
00:15:12,107 --> 00:15:16,416
I don't take orders from Orc-maggots.

140
00:15:17,645 --> 00:15:20,579
Saruman will have his prize.

141
00:15:21,016 --> 00:15:24,049
We will deliver them.

142
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,603
Merry!

143
00:15:32,461 --> 00:15:34,183
Merry? Wake up.

144
00:15:37,667 --> 00:15:39,455
My friend is sick.

145
00:15:40,069 --> 00:15:42,524
He needs water. Please!

146
00:15:43,405 --> 00:15:47,202
Sick, is he?
Give him some medicine, boys!

147
00:15:50,579 --> 00:15:52,204
Stop it!

148
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:57,035
Can't take his draught!

149
00:15:59,722 --> 00:16:02,242
- Leave him alone!
- Why?

150
00:16:02,926 --> 00:16:05,195
You want some?

151
00:16:06,061 --> 00:16:09,226
Then keep your mouth shut.

152
00:16:12,702 --> 00:16:14,644
Merry.

153
00:16:15,638 --> 00:16:17,165
Hello, Pip.

154
00:16:19,075 --> 00:16:21,344
- You're hurt.
- I'm fine.

155
00:16:21,577 --> 00:16:24,065
- It was just an act.
- An act?

156
00:16:24,747 --> 00:16:27,497
See? I fooled you too.

157
00:16:30,387 --> 00:16:32,077
Don't worry about me, Pippin.

158
00:16:34,425 --> 00:16:36,334
What is it? What do you smell?

159
00:16:37,393 --> 00:16:38,572
Man-flesh.

160
00:16:40,764 --> 00:16:43,131
They've picked up our trail.

161
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:45,383
Aragorn.

162
00:16:47,205 --> 00:16:48,960
Let's move!

163
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:14,985
Their pace has quickened.

164
00:17:16,134 --> 00:17:18,021
They must have caught our scent.

165
00:17:18,236 --> 00:17:19,958
Hurry!

166
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:25,298
Come on, Gimli!

167
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:31,385
Three days and nights pursuit.

168
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:34,463
No food. No rest.

169
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:38,550
And no sign of our quarry,
but what bare rock can tell.

170
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:13,255
Not idly do the leaves of Lórien fall.

171
00:18:14,694 --> 00:18:17,061
They may yet be alive.

172
00:18:18,031 --> 00:18:20,452
Less than a day ahead of us. Come.

173
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:25,538
Come, Gimli! We're gaining on them!

174
00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:30,030
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.

175
00:18:30,644 --> 00:18:33,873
Very dangerous over short distances.

176
00:18:45,659 --> 00:18:47,350
Rohan.

177
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:50,311
Home of the Horse-lords.

178
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:54,119
There's something strange at work here.

179
00:18:54,368 --> 00:18:57,215
Some evil gives speed
to these creatures.

180
00:18:57,504 --> 00:19:00,351
Sets its will against us.

181
00:19:05,614 --> 00:19:08,396
Legolas! What do your Elf-eyes see?

182
00:19:08,649 --> 00:19:11,168
The Uruks turn northeast.

183
00:19:12,153 --> 00:19:14,192
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.

184
00:19:15,189 --> 00:19:16,333
Saruman.

185
00:19:24,932 --> 00:19:27,965
The world is changing.

186
00:19:28,237 --> 00:19:33,506
Who now has the strength to stand
against the armies of Isengard...

187
00:19:34,476 --> 00:19:37,159
...and Mordor?

188
00:19:39,014 --> 00:19:44,316
<i>To stand against the might of Sauron
and Saruman...</i>

189
00:19:44,686 --> 00:19:48,231
...and the union of the two towers?

190
00:19:54,963 --> 00:19:57,833
Together, my Lord Sauron...

191
00:19:58,101 --> 00:20:01,396
...we shall rule this Middle-earth.

192
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:21,810
The Old World will burn
in the fires of industry.

193
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:25,556
The forests will fall.

194
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:30,380
A new order will rise.

195
00:20:31,569 --> 00:20:36,303
We will drive the machine of war
with the sword and the spear...

196
00:20:36,639 --> 00:20:40,436
...and the iron fists of the Orc.

197
00:20:53,189 --> 00:20:56,256
I want them armed and ready to march
within two weeks!

198
00:20:56,527 --> 00:20:58,152
But, my lord, there are too many!

199
00:20:58,361 --> 00:21:01,263
They cannot all be armed in time,
we don't have the means.

200
00:21:01,532 --> 00:21:04,467
Build a dam, block the stream,
work the furnaces night and day.

201
00:21:05,303 --> 00:21:07,506
We don't have enough fuel
to feed the fires.

202
00:21:09,075 --> 00:21:13,133
The Forest of Fangorn
lies on our doorstep.

203
00:21:14,645 --> 00:21:17,011
- Burn it.
- Yes.

204
00:21:17,717 --> 00:21:20,017
We will fight for you.

205
00:21:20,252 --> 00:21:22,161
Swear it.

206
00:21:32,665 --> 00:21:37,301
We will die for Saruman.

207
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:40,480
The Horse-Men took your lands.

208
00:21:40,706 --> 00:21:45,145
They drove your people into the hills
to scratch a living off rocks.

209
00:21:45,477 --> 00:21:46,939
Murderers!

210
00:21:47,747 --> 00:21:49,950
Take back the lands they stole from you.

211
00:21:50,181 --> 00:21:51,937
Burn every village!

212
00:21:55,186 --> 00:22:00,075
We have only to remove those
who oppose us.

213
00:22:00,693 --> 00:22:03,180
It will begin in Rohan.

214
00:22:04,096 --> 00:22:07,391
Too long have these peasants
stood against you.

215
00:22:07,667 --> 00:22:09,423
But no more.

216
00:22:09,634 --> 00:22:11,936
Éothain! Éothain!

217
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:24,700
<i><font color="#800080">♫ And on thaere hwile</font></i>
<i><font color="#FFFF00">(And in that moment)</font></i>

218
00:22:14,174 --> 00:22:16,629
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.

219
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,664
Papa says Éothain must not ride Garulf.

220
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:21,573
He is too big for him.

221
00:22:21,781 --> 00:22:24,650
Listen to me. You must ride to Edoras
and raise the alarm.

222
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:44,700

223
00:22:25,084 --> 00:22:27,418
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.

224
00:22:27,753 --> 00:22:30,569
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.

225
00:22:30,992 --> 00:22:34,438
Freda, I will find you there.

226
00:22:39,533 --> 00:22:41,224
Quickly!

227
00:22:45,100 --> 00:23:02,700

Go, child.

229
00:23:02,156 --> 00:23:04,011
Rohan, my lord...

230
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:07,109
...is ready to fall.

231
00:23:18,473 --> 00:23:20,000
Théodred.

232
00:23:20,241 --> 00:23:21,702
Find the king's son!

233
00:23:38,293 --> 00:23:44,075
- Mordor will pay for this.
- These Orcs are not from Mordor.

234
00:23:45,266 --> 00:23:48,017
My Lord Éomer, over here!

235
00:23:56,811 --> 00:23:58,568
He's alive.

236
00:24:29,478 --> 00:24:31,453
Théodred.

237
00:24:45,028 --> 00:24:47,930
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.

238
00:24:48,398 --> 00:24:50,701
He was ambushed by Orcs.

239
00:24:52,436 --> 00:24:55,981
If we don't defend our country,
Saruman will take it by force.

240
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,894
That is a lie.

241
00:25:01,212 --> 00:25:05,817
Saruman the White has ever been
our friend and ally.

242
00:25:07,551 --> 00:25:09,492
Grima.

243
00:25:11,089 --> 00:25:12,976
Grima.

244
00:25:15,494 --> 00:25:17,020
Grima.

245
00:25:17,761 --> 00:25:20,827
Orcs are roaming freely
across our lands.

246
00:25:21,298 --> 00:25:24,812
Unchecked. Unchallenged.
Killing at will.

247
00:25:25,537 --> 00:25:28,351
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.

248
00:25:36,347 --> 00:25:41,911
Why do you lay these troubles
on an already troubled mind?

249
00:25:42,287 --> 00:25:44,588
Can you not see?

250
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:49,845
Your uncle is wearied
by your malcontent...

251
00:25:50,195 --> 00:25:52,528
...your warmongering.

252
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,708
Warmongering?

253
00:25:57,102 --> 00:25:59,142
How long is it since
Saruman bought you?

254
00:26:00,105 --> 00:26:02,308
What was the promised price, Grima?

255
00:26:02,607 --> 00:26:06,120
When all the Men are dead,
you will take your share of the treasure?

256
00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:21,243
Too long have you watched my sister.

257
00:26:21,526 --> 00:26:23,436
Too long have you haunted her steps.

258
00:26:31,571 --> 00:26:35,826
You see much, Éomer, son of Éomund.

259
00:26:36,142 --> 00:26:37,223
Too much.

260
00:26:39,579 --> 00:26:44,216
You are banished forthwith
from the kingdom of Rohan...

261
00:26:44,551 --> 00:26:49,187
...and all its domains
under pain of death.

262
00:26:49,756 --> 00:26:52,123
You have no authority here.

263
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:54,660
Your orders mean nothing.

264
00:26:55,361 --> 00:26:59,071
This order does not come from me.

265
00:26:59,366 --> 00:27:01,407
It comes from the king.

266
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:04,558
He signed it this morning.

267
00:27:25,749 --> 00:27:35,200

Keep breathing. That's the key.

270
00:27:39,272 --> 00:27:40,931
Breathe.

271
00:27:44,749 --> 00:27:55,200
<i><font color="#0080C0">♫ [Ró]mello vanwa, [Va]limar!</font></i>

00:27:45,114 --> 00:27:48,822
They've run as if the very whips
of their masters were behind them.

<i><font color="#FFFF00">(Maybe even thou shalt find it!)</font></i>

We're not going no further...

275
00:28:07,236 --> 00:28:09,146
...until we've had a breather.

276
00:28:09,706 --> 00:28:11,592
Get a fire going!

277
00:28:15,745 --> 00:28:17,305
Merry!

278
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,055
Merry!

279
00:28:20,717 --> 00:28:25,833
I think we might have made a mistake
leaving the Shire, Pippin.

280
00:28:35,432 --> 00:28:37,504
What's making that noise?

281
00:28:39,269 --> 00:28:40,578
It's the trees.

282
00:28:41,437 --> 00:28:42,420
What?

283
00:28:42,772 --> 00:28:46,448
You remember the Old Forest,
on the borders of Buckland?

284
00:28:46,776 --> 00:28:51,150
Folk used to say there was something in
the water that made the trees grow tall...

285
00:28:51,514 --> 00:28:53,041
...and come alive.

286
00:28:53,317 --> 00:28:54,974
Alive?

287
00:28:55,786 --> 00:28:57,444
Trees that could whisper...

288
00:28:58,555 --> 00:29:00,976
...talk to each other...

289
00:29:01,224 --> 00:29:02,981
...even move.

290
00:29:04,562 --> 00:29:06,831
I'm starving.

291
00:29:07,065 --> 00:29:10,959
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread
for three stinking days.

292
00:29:11,435 --> 00:29:12,612
Yeah!

293
00:29:13,003 --> 00:29:16,102
Why can't we have some meat?!

294
00:29:18,542 --> 00:29:20,614
What about them?

295
00:29:21,012 --> 00:29:22,866
They're fresh.

296
00:29:23,481 --> 00:29:27,125
They are not for eating.

297
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:35,177
What about their legs?

298
00:29:35,394 --> 00:29:37,597
They don't need those.

299
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:42,230
- They look tasty.
- Get back, scum!

300
00:29:44,235 --> 00:29:48,937
The prisoners go to Saruman.
Alive and unspoiled.

301
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,329
Alive?

302
00:29:54,379 --> 00:29:58,437
Why alive?
Do they give good sport?

303
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,283
They have something.
An Elvish weapon.

304
00:30:04,557 --> 00:30:07,459
The master wants it for the war.

305
00:30:10,496 --> 00:30:12,318
They think we have the Ring.

306
00:30:12,531 --> 00:30:14,953
As soon as they find out we don't,
we're dead.

307
00:30:16,768 --> 00:30:18,678
Just a mouthful...

308
00:30:19,071 --> 00:30:20,183
...a bit of the flank.

309
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:30,395
Looks like meat's back on the menu,
boys.

310
00:30:37,223 --> 00:30:38,402
Pippin.

311
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:40,282
Let's go.

312
00:30:48,701 --> 00:30:50,228
Go on.

313
00:30:50,469 --> 00:30:51,963
Call for help.

314
00:30:53,341 --> 00:30:54,388
Squeal.

315
00:30:54,608 --> 00:30:57,608
No one's going to save you now.

316
00:31:07,053 --> 00:31:08,330
Pippin!

317
00:31:32,648 --> 00:31:35,102
A red sun rises.

318
00:31:35,649 --> 00:31:38,464
Blood has been spilled this night.

319
00:32:09,717 --> 00:32:11,539
Riders of Rohan...

320
00:32:12,155 --> 00:32:14,423
...what news from the Mark?

321
00:32:42,318 --> 00:32:46,475
What business does an Elf, a Man
and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?

322
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:48,635
Speak quickly!

323
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:53,534
Give me your name, horse-master,
and I shall give you mine.

324
00:33:02,806 --> 00:33:05,294
I would cut off your head, Dwarf...

325
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:08,164
...if it stood but a little higher
from the ground.

326
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:11,253
You would die before your stroke fell.

327
00:33:20,124 --> 00:33:21,946
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

328
00:33:22,326 --> 00:33:26,318
This is Gimli, son of Glóin,
and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.

329
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:29,858
We are friends of Rohan
and of Théoden, your king.

330
00:33:31,602 --> 00:33:35,246
Théoden no longer recognizes
friend from foe.

331
00:33:35,606 --> 00:33:37,647
Not even his own kin.

332
00:33:42,347 --> 00:33:44,234
Saruman has poisoned the mind
of the king...

333
00:33:44,483 --> 00:33:46,337
...and claimed lordship over these lands.

334
00:33:48,387 --> 00:33:51,257
My company are those loyal to Rohan.

335
00:33:51,556 --> 00:33:53,279
And for that, we are banished.

336
00:33:55,394 --> 00:33:58,525
The White Wizard is cunning.

337
00:33:59,397 --> 00:34:01,634
He walks here and there, they say...

338
00:34:02,034 --> 00:34:03,922
...as an old man hooded and cloaked.

339
00:34:05,737 --> 00:34:09,414
And everywhere, his spies
slip past our nets.

340
00:34:09,708 --> 00:34:11,977
We are no spies.

341
00:34:12,211 --> 00:34:15,025
We track a party of Uruk-hai
westward across the plain.

342
00:34:15,413 --> 00:34:17,585
They have taken two of our friends
captive.

343
00:34:18,518 --> 00:34:20,973
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.

344
00:34:21,221 --> 00:34:24,219
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?

345
00:34:24,489 --> 00:34:27,359
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.

346
00:34:30,763 --> 00:34:32,672
We left none alive.

347
00:34:33,465 --> 00:34:36,281
We piled the carcasses and burned them.

348
00:34:41,809 --> 00:34:43,117
Dead?

349
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:47,705
I am sorry.

350
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:55,591
Hasufel! Arod!

351
00:34:57,523 --> 00:35:02,029
May these horses bear you to better
fortune than their former masters.

352
00:35:03,396 --> 00:35:04,989
Farewell.

353
00:35:10,204 --> 00:35:12,342
Look for your friends.

354
00:35:12,973 --> 00:35:15,078
But do not trust to hope.

355
00:35:16,743 --> 00:35:19,263
It has forsaken these lands.

356
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:21,468
We ride north!

357
00:36:12,234 --> 00:36:14,022
It's one of their wee belts.

358
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,000
<font color="#008000">Hiro hyn hîdh ab ’wanath.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">(Let they find peace in the afterlife.)</font>

359
00:36:27,783 --> 00:36:29,692
We failed them.

360
00:36:44,034 --> 00:36:46,074
A Hobbit lay here.

361
00:36:48,071 --> 00:36:49,532
And the other.

362
00:37:00,451 --> 00:37:02,043
They crawled.

363
00:37:06,189 --> 00:37:08,163
Their hands were bound.

364
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:22,192
Their bonds were cut.

365
00:37:37,654 --> 00:37:39,662
They ran over here.

366
00:37:43,495 --> 00:37:44,574
They were followed.

367
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:49,526
The belt!

368
00:37:53,538 --> 00:37:54,585
Run!

369
00:37:58,409 --> 00:37:59,620
Tracks lead away from the battle...

370
00:38:04,516 --> 00:38:06,490
...into Fangorn Forest.

371
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:08,980
Fangorn?

372
00:38:09,187 --> 00:38:11,608
What madness drove them in there?

373
00:38:29,508 --> 00:38:32,379
Did we lose him? I think we lost him.

374
00:38:39,284 --> 00:38:42,481
I'm going to rip out
your filthy little innards!

375
00:38:48,995 --> 00:38:49,943
Come here!

376
00:38:55,435 --> 00:38:57,955
Trees. Climb a tree.

377
00:39:07,314 --> 00:39:09,004
He's gone.

378
00:39:21,162 --> 00:39:23,365
Merry!

379
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:39,166
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!

380
00:39:46,454 --> 00:39:47,980
Run, Merry!

381
00:39:57,732 --> 00:40:02,008
Little Orcs.

382
00:40:02,336 --> 00:40:04,508
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.

383
00:40:04,739 --> 00:40:06,594
Tree?

384
00:40:06,809 --> 00:40:09,678
I am no tree!

385
00:40:10,146 --> 00:40:12,217
I am an Ent.

386
00:40:12,781 --> 00:40:14,985
A tree-herder.

387
00:40:15,518 --> 00:40:17,404
A shepherd of the forest.

388
00:40:17,619 --> 00:40:19,048
Don't talk to it, Merry.

389
00:40:19,521 --> 00:40:21,015
Don't encourage it!

390
00:40:21,256 --> 00:40:25,282
Treebeard, some call me.

391
00:40:25,594 --> 00:40:27,482
And whose side are you on?

392
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:29,691
Side?

393
00:40:30,099 --> 00:40:32,717
I am on nobody's side...

394
00:40:33,302 --> 00:40:38,353
...because nobody's on my side,
little Orc.

395
00:40:39,443 --> 00:40:43,915
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.

396
00:40:44,447 --> 00:40:46,684
We're not Orcs! We're Hobbits!

397
00:40:47,082 --> 00:40:49,220
Hobbits?

398
00:40:50,519 --> 00:40:55,222
Never heard of a Hobbit before.

399
00:40:56,593 --> 00:41:00,967
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!

400
00:41:01,332 --> 00:41:03,338
They come with fire.

401
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,120
They come with axes.

402
00:41:06,403 --> 00:41:11,040
Gnawing, biting, breaking,
hacking, burning!

403
00:41:11,409 --> 00:41:15,085
- Destroyers and usurpers! Curse them!
- No!

404
00:41:15,412 --> 00:41:18,161
You don't understand. We're Hobbits!

405
00:41:18,448 --> 00:41:20,204
Halflings!

406
00:41:20,449 --> 00:41:21,497
Shire-folk!

407
00:41:21,685 --> 00:41:24,019
Maybe you are...

408
00:41:24,387 --> 00:41:27,933
...and maybe you aren't.

409
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:32,934
The White Wizard will know.

410
00:41:33,763 --> 00:41:35,618
The White Wizard?

411
00:41:37,335 --> 00:41:38,676
Saruman.

412
00:41:51,382 --> 00:41:53,040
See? See?

413
00:41:53,316 --> 00:41:55,553
We've led you out.

414
00:41:55,786 --> 00:41:58,274
Hurry, Hobbitses. Hurry!

415
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:03,881
Very lucky we find you.

416
00:42:10,568 --> 00:42:12,260
Nice Hobbit.

417
00:42:15,274 --> 00:42:18,371
It's a bog. He's led us into a swamp.

418
00:42:18,645 --> 00:42:21,229
A swamp, yes, yes.

419
00:42:22,113 --> 00:42:26,553
Come, master. We will take you
on safe paths through the mist.

420
00:42:29,155 --> 00:42:32,416
Come, Hobbits! Come! We go quickly.

421
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:38,347
I found it. I did.

422
00:42:38,631 --> 00:42:41,215
The way through the marshes.

423
00:42:41,533 --> 00:42:44,949
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.

424
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:49,166
They go around for miles and miles.

425
00:42:49,509 --> 00:42:50,970
Come quickly.

426
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:55,072
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.

427
00:42:56,381 --> 00:42:59,513
I hate this place. It's too quiet.

428
00:42:59,819 --> 00:43:02,088
There's been no sight nor sound
of a bird for two days.

429
00:43:02,323 --> 00:43:05,485
No, no birdses to eat.

430
00:43:05,992 --> 00:43:10,018
No crunchable birdses.

431
00:43:10,697 --> 00:43:13,479
We are famished! Yes!

432
00:43:13,733 --> 00:43:17,989
Famished we are, precious!

433
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,494
Here.

434
00:43:35,723 --> 00:43:37,665
What does it eats?

435
00:43:38,058 --> 00:43:39,945
Is it tasty?

436
00:43:45,299 --> 00:43:47,689
It tries to chokes us!

437
00:43:48,203 --> 00:43:51,585
We can't eats Hobbit food!

438
00:43:53,508 --> 00:43:57,369
We must starve!

439
00:43:57,678 --> 00:44:00,045
Well, starve, then. And good riddance!

440
00:44:00,782 --> 00:44:03,019
Oh, cruel Hobbit.

441
00:44:03,251 --> 00:44:06,001
It does not care if we be hungry.

442
00:44:06,321 --> 00:44:10,892
Does not care if we should die.

443
00:44:11,626 --> 00:44:14,375
Not like master.

444
00:44:15,798 --> 00:44:17,969
Master cares.

445
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,022
Master knows.

446
00:44:23,505 --> 00:44:25,393
Yes.

447
00:44:25,608 --> 00:44:28,193
Precious.

448
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:35,326
Once it takes hold of us...

449
00:44:37,353 --> 00:44:41,346
...it never lets go.

450
00:44:42,258 --> 00:44:43,338
Don't touch me!

451
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:30,000

452
00:45:15,759 --> 00:45:17,581
There are dead things!

453
00:45:17,795 --> 00:45:19,517
Dead faces in the water.

454
00:45:24,469 --> 00:45:28,265
All dead. All rotten.

455
00:45:29,039 --> 00:45:32,519
Elves and Men and Orcses.

456
00:45:33,043 --> 00:45:36,391
A great battle long ago.

457
00:45:37,381 --> 00:45:39,104
Dead Marshes.

458
00:45:39,350 --> 00:45:42,001
Yes. Yes, that is their name.

459
00:45:43,688 --> 00:45:45,410
This way.


460
00:45:45,623 --> 00:45:48,306
Don't follow the lights.

461
00:45:50,227 --> 00:45:53,470
Careful now! Or Hobbits go down
to join the dead ones...

- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.

466
00:47:15,349 --> 00:47:17,170
- Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!

467
00:47:17,383 --> 00:47:19,205
Are you all right?

468
00:47:48,216 --> 00:47:51,062
So bright.

469
00:47:51,352 --> 00:47:55,029
So beautiful.

470
00:47:55,322 --> 00:47:59,032
Our precious.

471
00:48:00,595 --> 00:48:02,122
What did you say?

472
00:48:02,330 --> 00:48:04,370
Master should be resting.

473
00:48:04,599 --> 00:48:08,493
Master needs to keep up his strength.

474
00:48:10,638 --> 00:48:13,900
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us. Not its business.

475
00:48:14,174 --> 00:48:15,516
Gollum. Gollum.

476
00:48:15,744 --> 00:48:17,500
Gandalf told me you were
one of the river-folk.

477
00:48:17,713 --> 00:48:21,803
<i>Cold be heart and hand and bone
Cold be travelers far from home</i>

478
00:48:22,118 --> 00:48:23,524
He said your life was a sad story.

00:48:28,523 --> 00:48:31,393
You were not so very different
from a Hobbit once.

481
00:48:31,661 --> 00:48:33,384
Were you?

482
00:48:35,631 --> 00:48:37,900
Sméagol.

483
00:48:42,604 --> 00:48:45,092
What did you call me?

484
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:49,192
That was your name once, wasn't it?

485
00:48:49,779 --> 00:48:52,146
A long time ago.

486
00:48:53,115 --> 00:48:55,155
My name.

487
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:57,661
My name.

488
00:49:04,594 --> 00:49:07,049
Sméagol.

489
00:49:11,268 --> 00:49:12,893
Black Riders!

490
00:49:13,102 --> 00:49:14,346
Hide! Hide!

491
00:49:25,048 --> 00:49:27,219
Come on, Frodo. Come on!

492
00:49:27,451 --> 00:49:30,996
Quick! They will see us!
They will see us!

493
00:49:31,788 --> 00:49:34,407
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?

494
00:49:34,659 --> 00:49:37,473
No, you cannot kill them. No.

Wraiths on wings!

499
00:50:16,334 --> 00:50:18,309

I'm here.

504
00:50:43,796 --> 00:50:45,356
Hurry, Hobbits.

505
00:50:45,865 --> 00:50:49,660
The Black Gate is very close.

506

Orc blood.

507
00:51:08,555 --> 00:51:10,279
These are strange tracks.

508
00:51:11,592 --> 00:51:13,533
The air is so close in here.

509
00:51:14,761 --> 00:51:17,150
This forest is old.

510
00:51:18,098 --> 00:51:20,007
Very old.

511
00:51:21,734 --> 00:51:24,035
Full of memory...

512
00:51:26,673 --> 00:51:29,007
...and anger.

513
00:51:35,249 --> 00:51:38,063
The trees are speaking to each other.

Gimli!

515
00:51:40,054 --> 00:51:41,744
Lower your ax.

516
00:51:44,658 --> 00:51:47,340
They have feelings, my friend.

517
00:51:48,094 --> 00:51:49,982
The Elves began it.

518
00:51:50,231 --> 00:51:54,638
Waking up the trees,
teaching them to speak.

519
00:51:55,436 --> 00:51:57,640
Talking trees.

520
00:51:58,441 --> 00:52:01,342
What do trees have to talk about?

521
00:52:01,610 --> 00:52:04,609
Except the consistency
of squirrel droppings.

524
00:52:18,727 --> 00:52:21,148
The White Wizard approaches.

00:52:27,403 --> 00:52:31,460
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.

526
00:52:41,316 --> 00:52:43,422
We must be quick.

527
00:52:59,168 --> 00:53:02,583
You are tracking the footsteps
of two young Hobbits.

528
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:04,616
Where are they?

529
00:53:04,807 --> 00:53:08,287
They passed this way
the day before yesterday.

530
00:53:08,611 --> 00:53:12,636
They met someone they did not expect.

531
00:53:13,149 --> 00:53:15,157
Does that comfort you?

532
00:53:15,384 --> 00:53:17,272

Show yourself!

I mistook you for Saruman.

Or rather, Saruman

543
00:53:49,219 --> 00:53:50,561
You fell.

544
00:53:52,189 --> 00:53:54,523
Through fire...

545
00:53:54,759 --> 00:53:56,133
...and water.

<i>...and smote his ruin

550
00:54:33,265 --> 00:54:35,632
Darkness took me...

551
00:54:36,535 --> 00:54:40,429
...and I strayed out of thought
and time.

552
00:54:41,406 --> 00:54:44,341
Stars wheeled overhead...

553
00:54:44,677 --> 00:54:49,084
...and every day was as long
as a life age of the Earth.

554
00:54:51,383 --> 00:54:53,390
But it was not the end.

555
00:54:53,719 --> 00:54:56,435
I felt life in me again.

556
00:54:58,525 --> 00:55:01,012
I've been sent back...

557
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:02,667
...until my task is done.

558
00:55:03,195 --> 00:55:05,049
Gandalf.

559
00:55:05,698 --> 00:55:07,586
Gandalf?

560
00:55:08,201 --> 00:55:09,956
Yes.

561
00:55:12,672 --> 00:55:14,428
That was what they used to call me.

562
00:55:17,409 --> 00:55:19,514
Gandalf the Grey.

563
00:55:21,081 --> 00:55:22,641
That was my name.

564
00:55:23,017 --> 00:55:24,325
Gandalf.

565
00:55:26,354 --> 00:55:28,328
I am Gandalf the White.

566
00:55:31,459 --> 00:55:34,360
And I come back to you now...

567
00:55:34,661 --> 00:55:37,117
...at the turn of the tide.

568
00:55:38,332 --> 00:55:41,179
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.

569
00:55:42,103 --> 00:55:45,102
- We must travel to Edoras with all speed.
- Edoras?

570
00:55:46,173 --> 00:55:48,147
That is no short distance!

571
00:55:48,441 --> 00:55:51,507
We hear of trouble in Rohan.
It goes ill with the king.

572
00:55:51,778 --> 00:55:53,753
Yes, and it will not be easily cured.

573
00:55:54,181 --> 00:55:57,377
Then we have run all this way for nothing?

574
00:55:57,685 --> 00:55:59,572
Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here...

575
00:55:59,821 --> 00:56:03,943
...in this horrid, dark, dank,
tree-infested...?

576
00:56:06,627 --> 00:56:09,627
I mean, charming...

577

...quite charming forest.

578
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:16,878

brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.

Oh, that's good.

So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.

is drawing near.

633
01:00:50,185 --> 01:00:54,211
The veiling shadow that glowers
in the east takes shape.

634
01:00:55,224 --> 01:00:57,612
Sauron will suffer no rival.

635
01:00:58,260 --> 01:01:02,318
From the summit of Barad-dûr,
his Eye watches ceaselessly.

636
01:01:02,631 --> 01:01:05,947
But he is not so mighty yet
that he is above fear.

637
01:01:07,136 --> 01:01:09,024
Doubt ever gnaws at him.

638
01:01:09,239 --> 01:01:11,605
The rumor has reached him.

639
01:01:12,041 --> 01:01:14,724
The heir of Nûmenor still lives.

640
01:01:15,812 --> 01:01:18,562
Sauron fears you, Aragorn.

641
01:01:20,116 --> 01:01:22,188
He fears what you may become.

642
01:01:23,486 --> 01:01:26,682
And so he'll strike hard and fast
at the world of Men.

643
01:01:27,156 --> 01:01:30,505
He will use his puppet, Saruman,
to destroy Rohan.

644
01:01:30,828 --> 01:01:32,321
War is coming.

645
01:01:32,528 --> 01:01:36,041
Rohan must defend itself,
and therein lies our first challenge...

646
01:01:36,332 --> 01:01:38,601
...for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.

647
01:01:38,836 --> 01:01:42,413
The king's mind is enslaved,
it's an old device of Saruman's.

648
01:01:42,739 --> 01:01:45,674
His hold over King Théoden
is now very strong.

649
01:01:46,110 --> 01:01:50,517
Sauron and Saruman
are tightening the noose.

650
01:01:51,547 --> 01:01:53,587
But for all their cunning...

651
01:01:53,851 --> 01:01:56,372
...we have one advantage.

652
01:01:58,589 --> 01:02:01,109
The Ring remains hidden.

653
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:04,081
And that we should seek to destroy it...

654
01:02:04,328 --> 01:02:07,175
...has not yet entered
their darkest dreams.

655
01:02:07,799 --> 01:02:11,059
And so the weapon of the enemy
is moving towards Mordor...

656
01:02:11,367 --> 01:02:12,710
...in the hands of a Hobbit.

657
01:02:13,071 --> 01:02:16,999
Each day brings it closer
to the fires of Mount Doom.

658
01:02:17,308 --> 01:02:19,728
We must trust now in Frodo.

659
01:02:20,145 --> 01:02:21,771
Everything depends upon speed...

660
01:02:22,147 --> 01:02:25,015
...and the secrecy of his quest.

661
01:02:27,117 --> 01:02:30,249
Do not regret your decision to leave him.

662
01:02:31,290 --> 01:02:33,972
Frodo must finish this task alone.

663
01:02:34,691 --> 01:02:37,058
He's not alone.

664
01:02:37,295 --> 01:02:38,788
Sam went with him.

665
01:02:39,597 --> 01:02:40,710
Did he?

666
01:02:41,065 --> 01:02:45,408
Did he, indeed? Good.

667
01:02:46,272 --> 01:02:48,540
Yes, very good.

668
01:02:56,648 --> 01:03:01,350
The Black Gate of Mordor.

669
01:03:04,323 --> 01:03:06,657
Oh, save us.

670
01:03:12,564 --> 01:03:15,631
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two
to say if he could see us now.

671
01:03:18,137 --> 01:03:22,327
Master says to show him
the way into Mordor.

672
01:03:22,676 --> 01:03:26,058
So good Sméagol does,
master says so.

673
01:03:26,345 --> 01:03:27,490
I did.

674
01:03:36,323 --> 01:03:38,264
That's it, then.

675
01:03:39,826 --> 01:03:41,167
We can't get past that.

676
01:04:26,373 --> 01:04:27,618
Look!

677
01:04:27,808 --> 01:04:29,302
The gate.

678
01:04:29,510 --> 01:04:30,622
It's opening!

679
01:04:38,186 --> 01:04:40,095
I can see a way down.

680
01:04:40,789 --> 01:04:42,960
Sam, no!

681
01:04:45,193 --> 01:04:46,437
Master!

682
01:06:10,348 --> 01:06:13,643
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.

683
01:06:14,586 --> 01:06:17,584
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks
will hide us in there.

684
01:06:18,256 --> 01:06:20,044
- Now!
- No!

685
01:06:20,624 --> 01:06:22,511
No! No, master!

686
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:25,630
They catch you! They catch you!

687
01:06:27,165 --> 01:06:29,532
Don't take it to him.

688
01:06:32,570 --> 01:06:35,220
He wants the precious.

689
01:06:35,506 --> 01:06:38,375
Always he is looking for it.

690
01:06:38,676 --> 01:06:42,419
And the precious is wanting
to go back to him.

691
01:06:42,782 --> 01:06:46,555
But we mustn't let him have it.

692
01:06:53,191 --> 01:06:55,198
No! There's another way.

693
01:06:55,460 --> 01:06:58,046
More secret. A dark way.

694
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:02,009
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.

695
01:07:02,535 --> 01:07:03,517
He's up to something.

696
01:07:04,236 --> 01:07:06,625
Are you saying there's another way
into Mordor?

697
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:09,526
Yes. There's a path...

698
01:07:09,809 --> 01:07:12,265
...and some stairs.

699
01:07:12,546 --> 01:07:14,203
And then...

700
01:07:14,413 --> 01:07:17,577
...a tunnel.

701
01:07:31,698 --> 01:07:33,453
He's led us this far, Sam.

702
01:07:33,667 --> 01:07:35,095
Mr. Frodo, no.

703
01:07:36,303 --> 01:07:37,611
He's been true to his word.

704
01:07:42,576 --> 01:07:43,689
No.

705
01:07:46,046 --> 01:07:47,475
Lead the way, Sméagol.

706
01:07:48,248 --> 01:07:52,023
Good Sméagol always helps.

707
01:08:26,154 --> 01:08:27,102
Hello?

708
01:08:29,490 --> 01:08:31,465
Treebeard?

709
01:08:32,260 --> 01:08:33,537
Where has he gone?

710
01:08:33,729 --> 01:08:36,149
I had the loveliest dream last night.

711
01:08:36,797 --> 01:08:39,415
There was this large barrel,
full of pipe-weed.

712
01:08:39,667 --> 01:08:42,154
And we smoked all of it.
And then...

713
01:08:42,669 --> 01:08:44,557
...you were sick.

714
01:08:46,308 --> 01:08:49,058
I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.

715
01:08:52,581 --> 01:08:54,468
Did you hear that?

716
01:09:01,622 --> 01:09:03,030
There it is again.

717
01:09:04,027 --> 01:09:08,369
Something's not right here.
Not right at all.

718
01:09:12,367 --> 01:09:15,181
You just said something... Treeish.

719
01:09:15,470 --> 01:09:19,267
No, I didn't. I was just stretching.

720
01:09:27,083 --> 01:09:28,741
You're taller.

721
01:09:29,419 --> 01:09:30,760
- Who?
- You!

722
01:09:31,153 --> 01:09:32,615
- Than what?
- Than me!

723
01:09:33,255 --> 01:09:35,295
I've always been taller than you.

724
01:09:35,525 --> 01:09:40,031
Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one.
You're the short one.

725
01:09:41,098 --> 01:09:42,472
Please, Merry.

726
01:09:42,665 --> 01:09:46,374
You're what? Three-foot-six? At the most?

727
01:09:47,170 --> 01:09:49,919
Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7".

728
01:09:52,176 --> 01:09:54,280
3'8"!

729
01:09:56,347 --> 01:09:58,135
Three-foot-eight.

730
01:10:01,252 --> 01:10:03,106
You did something.

731
01:10:08,859 --> 01:10:10,452
Merry, don't! Don't drink it!

732
01:10:11,462 --> 01:10:12,803
Merry!

733
01:10:13,163 --> 01:10:15,367
No, Treebeard said that you
shouldn't have any.

734
01:10:15,599 --> 01:10:19,340
- I want some!
- It could well be dangerous!

735
01:10:19,670 --> 01:10:21,710
Give me it back. Merry!

736
01:10:23,674 --> 01:10:25,082
What's happening?!

737
01:10:25,876 --> 01:10:27,338
It's got my leg!

738
01:10:27,712 --> 01:10:29,205
Merry!

739
01:10:48,599 --> 01:10:50,225
Help!

740
01:10:56,908 --> 01:10:58,731
Away with you.

741
01:10:59,111 --> 01:11:00,703
You should not be waking.

742
01:11:01,379 --> 01:11:06,048
Eat earth. Dig deep. Drink water.

743
01:11:06,750 --> 01:11:09,272
Go to sleep.

744
01:11:09,689 --> 01:11:11,510
Away with you.

745
01:11:11,724 --> 01:11:14,985
Come, the forest is waking up.

746
01:11:15,628 --> 01:11:17,482
It isn't safe.

747
01:11:20,266 --> 01:11:24,041
The trees have grown wild
and dangerous.

748
01:11:24,338 --> 01:11:27,240
Anger festers in their hearts.

749
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:29,701
Black are their thoughts.

750
01:11:30,077 --> 01:11:32,411
Strong is their hate.

751
01:11:32,679 --> 01:11:35,361
They will harm you if they can.

752
01:11:35,614 --> 01:11:39,094
There are too few of us now.

753
01:11:39,417 --> 01:11:43,215
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.

754
01:11:44,124 --> 01:11:46,513
Why are there so few of you
when you have lived so long?

755
01:11:46,793 --> 01:11:49,988
- Are there Ent children?
- Bru-ra-hroom.

756
01:11:50,262 --> 01:11:55,565
There have been no Entings
for a terrible long count of years.

757
01:11:56,103 --> 01:12:01,089
- Why is that?
- We lost the Entwives.

758
01:12:01,541 --> 01:12:02,817
Oh, I'm sorry.

759
01:12:03,110 --> 01:12:06,885
- How did they die?
- Die? No.

760
01:12:07,214 --> 01:12:10,246
We lost them.

761
01:12:10,549 --> 01:12:15,371
And now we cannot find them.

762
01:12:15,757 --> 01:12:21,833
I don't suppose you've seen Entwives
in the Shire?

763
01:12:22,262 --> 01:12:24,628
Can't say that I have.

764
01:12:25,299 --> 01:12:27,273
You, Pip?

765
01:12:28,736 --> 01:12:31,125
What do they look like?

766
01:12:33,608 --> 01:12:38,147
I don't remember now.

767
01:12:54,696 --> 01:12:58,470
Edoras and the Golden Hall
of Meduseld.

768
01:12:59,401 --> 01:13:02,019
There dwells Théoden, King of Rohan...

769
01:13:02,704 --> 01:13:05,453
...whose mind is overthrown.

770
01:13:05,707 --> 01:13:09,929
<i>Saruman 's hold over King Théoden
is now very strong.</i>

771
01:13:10,646 --> 01:13:13,645
My lord, your son...

772
01:13:14,082 --> 01:13:16,154
...he is dead.

773
01:13:17,686 --> 01:13:19,442
My lord?

774
01:13:20,756 --> 01:13:21,999
Uncle?

775
01:13:28,730 --> 01:13:31,000
Will you not go to him?

776
01:13:34,204 --> 01:13:36,440
Will you do nothing?

777
01:13:36,672 --> 01:13:38,582
Be careful what you say.

778
01:13:38,841 --> 01:13:41,045
Do not look for welcome here.

779
01:14:05,069 --> 01:14:09,029
Oh, he must have died
sometime in the night.

780
01:14:09,373 --> 01:14:11,413
What a tragedy for the king...

781
01:14:11,675 --> 01:14:14,521
...to lose his only son and heir.

782
01:14:15,745 --> 01:14:20,153
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.

783
01:14:20,484 --> 01:14:25,218
Especially now that your brother
has deserted you.

784
01:14:25,556 --> 01:14:27,051
Leave me alone, snake!

785
01:14:28,492 --> 01:14:30,117
Oh, but you are alone.

786
01:14:31,729 --> 01:14:36,333
Who knows what you've spoken
to the darkness...

787
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:40,048
...in the bitter watches of the night...

788
01:14:40,371 --> 01:14:43,949
...when all your life seems to shrink.

789
01:14:44,241 --> 01:14:48,234
The walls of your bower
closing in about you.

790
01:14:48,579 --> 01:14:53,019
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.

791
01:14:55,420 --> 01:14:57,241
So fair.

792
01:14:58,556 --> 01:14:59,964
So cold.

793
01:15:01,793 --> 01:15:03,963
Like a morning of pale spring...

794
01:15:04,228 --> 01:15:07,458
...still clinging to winter's chill.

795
01:15:21,414 --> 01:15:23,715
Your words are poison.

796
01:16:56,378 --> 01:16:58,679
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.

797
01:17:13,228 --> 01:17:16,905
I cannot allow you before Théoden King
so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.

798
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:20,987
By order of Grima Wormtongue.

799
01:17:38,420 --> 01:17:40,144
Your staff.

800
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:46,975
You would not part an old man
from his walking stick.

801
01:18:05,950 --> 01:18:08,568
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.

802
01:18:17,093 --> 01:18:18,500
He's a herald of woe.

803
01:18:18,729 --> 01:18:23,071
The courtesy of your hall
is somewhat lessened of late...

804
01:18:24,335 --> 01:18:25,643
...Théoden King.

805
01:18:26,470 --> 01:18:28,957
He's not welcome.

806
01:18:30,007 --> 01:18:35,058
Why should I welcome you...

807
01:18:35,713 --> 01:18:39,258
...Gandalf Stormcrow?

808
01:18:39,550 --> 01:18:42,845
A just question, my liege.

809
01:18:43,221 --> 01:18:46,003
Late is the hour...

810
01:18:46,257 --> 01:18:50,053
...in which this conjurer
chooses to appear.

811
01:18:51,062 --> 01:18:53,036
Láthspell I name him.

812
01:18:53,264 --> 01:18:56,078
Ill news is an ill guest.

813
01:18:56,333 --> 01:19:00,609
Be silent. Keep your forked tongue
behind your teeth.

814
01:19:01,138 --> 01:19:02,928
I have not passed
through fire and death...

815
01:19:03,141 --> 01:19:06,207
...to bandy crooked words
with a witless worm.

816
01:19:07,312 --> 01:19:09,318
His staff.

817
01:19:09,581 --> 01:19:13,509
I told you to take the wizard's staff.

818
01:19:17,155 --> 01:19:19,010
Théoden...

819
01:19:19,558 --> 01:19:22,078
...son of Thengel...

820
01:19:24,029 --> 01:19:26,233
...too long have you sat
in the Shadows.

821
01:19:29,301 --> 01:19:32,400
I would stay still if I were you.

822
01:19:32,671 --> 01:19:34,646
Hearken to me!

823
01:19:40,313 --> 01:19:42,352
I release you...

824
01:19:42,615 --> 01:19:44,502
...from the spell.

825
01:19:56,230 --> 01:19:59,098
You have no power here...

826
01:19:59,399 --> 01:20:02,910
...Gandalf the Grey.

I know your face.

Éowyn.

842
01:21:47,711 --> 01:21:48,823
Gandalf?

843
01:21:49,511 --> 01:21:52,261
Breathe the free air again, my friend.

844
01:22:05,662 --> 01:22:08,214
Dark have been my dreams of late.

845
01:22:12,435 --> 01:22:16,079
Your fingers would remember
their old strength better...

846
01:22:16,407 --> 01:22:19,253
...if they grasped your sword.

847
01:23:04,455 --> 01:23:06,364
I've only...

848
01:23:06,590 --> 01:23:09,492
...ever served you, my lord.

849
01:23:09,795 --> 01:23:14,584
Your leechcraft would have had me
crawling on all fours like a beast!

850
01:23:15,802 --> 01:23:17,657
Send me not from your sight.

851
01:23:20,172 --> 01:23:22,660
No, my lord! No, my lord.

852
01:23:23,109 --> 01:23:24,221
Let him go.

853
01:23:24,876 --> 01:23:28,104
Enough blood has been spilt
on his account.

854
01:23:37,356 --> 01:23:39,526
Get out of my way!

855

Hail, Théoden King!

856
01:24:09,622 --> 01:24:12,110
Where is Théodred?

857
01:24:15,228 --> 01:24:17,596

Now it shall cover the grave

Alas that these evil days
should be mine.

The young perish and the old linger.

868
01:26:14,084 --> 01:26:16,058
That I should live...

869

...to see the last days of my house.

870
01:26:20,789 --> 01:26:24,532
Théodred's death
was not of your making.

871
01:26:27,731 --> 01:26:31,080
No parent should have to bury
their child.

872
01:26:47,852 --> 01:26:49,673

They had no warning.

879
01:27:41,206 --> 01:27:43,444
They were unarmed.

880
01:27:44,077 --> 01:27:47,939
Now the Wild Men are moving through
the Westfold, burning as they go.

881
01:27:49,082 --> 01:27:50,804
Rick, cot and tree.

882
01:27:51,284 --> 01:27:53,389
Where is Mama?

883
01:27:54,287 --> 01:27:58,313
This is but a taste of the terror
that Saruman will unleash.

884
01:27:58,659 --> 01:28:02,914
All the more potent for he is driven now
by fear of Sauron.

885
01:28:04,298 --> 01:28:07,167
Ride out and meet him head on.

886
01:28:08,069 --> 01:28:11,329
Draw him away from your women
and children.

887
01:28:11,939 --> 01:28:13,400
You must fight.

888
01:28:13,774 --> 01:28:17,319
You have 2000 good men riding north
as we speak.

889
01:28:17,777 --> 01:28:19,238
Éomer is loyal to you.

890
01:28:19,446 --> 01:28:22,097
His men will return
and fight for their king.

891
01:28:22,349 --> 01:28:26,122
They will be 300 leagues from here
by now.

892
01:28:29,990 --> 01:28:32,095
Éomer cannot help us.

893
01:28:32,860 --> 01:28:34,453
I know what it is you want of me...

894
01:28:34,861 --> 01:28:37,927
...but I will not bring further death
to my people.

895
01:28:39,799 --> 01:28:41,294
I will not risk open war.

896
01:28:43,571 --> 01:28:46,888
Open war is upon you,
whether you would risk it or not.

897
01:28:51,279 --> 01:28:52,871
When last I looked...

898
01:28:53,314 --> 01:28:56,859
...Théoden, not Aragorn,
was king of Rohan.

899
01:29:03,858 --> 01:29:05,997
Then what is the king's decision?

900
01:29:11,733 --> 01:29:12,943
By order of the king...

901
01:29:13,168 --> 01:29:14,476
...the city must empty.

902
01:29:15,871 --> 01:29:18,620
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.

903
01:29:19,007 --> 01:29:22,749
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.

904
01:29:23,078 --> 01:29:24,453
Helm's Deep.

905
01:29:24,813 --> 01:29:28,107
They flee to the mountains
when they should stand and fight.

906
01:29:28,415 --> 01:29:30,303
Who will defend them if not their king?

907
01:29:30,519 --> 01:29:32,975
He's only doing what he thinks
is best for his people.

908
01:29:33,222 --> 01:29:34,978
Helm's Deep has saved them
in the past.

909
01:29:35,191 --> 01:29:38,966
There is no way out of that ravine.
Théoden is walking into a trap.

910
01:29:39,262 --> 01:29:41,334
He thinks he's leading them to safety.

911
01:29:41,563 --> 01:29:43,767
What they will get is a massacre.

912
01:29:45,333 --> 01:29:47,788
Théoden has a strong will,
but I fear for him.

913
01:29:48,805 --> 01:29:51,935
I fear for the survival of Rohan.

914
01:29:52,475 --> 01:29:55,257
He will need you before the end,
Aragorn.

915
01:29:55,945 --> 01:29:58,465
The people of Rohan will need you.

916
01:29:59,081 --> 01:30:01,349
The defenses have to hold.

917
01:30:02,985 --> 01:30:04,709
They will hold.

918
01:30:08,792 --> 01:30:10,930
The Grey Pilgrim.

919
01:30:11,195 --> 01:30:13,748
That's what they used to call me.

920
01:30:14,030 --> 01:30:18,885
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked
this earth, and now I have no time.

921
01:30:20,604 --> 01:30:22,840
With luck, my search will not
be in vain.

922
01:30:23,407 --> 01:30:26,667
Look to my coming at first light
on the fifth day.

923
01:30:27,544 --> 01:30:30,161
At dawn, look to the east.

924
01:30:30,447 --> 01:30:32,008
Go.

925
01:30:59,344 --> 01:31:02,508
That horse is half mad, my lord.
There's nothing you can do. Leave him.

He was my cousin's horse.

Brego?.

01:32:06,479 --> 01:32:09,774
...but I did not look for it
in a Ranger from the North.

942
01:32:10,950 --> 01:32:13,186
You speak as one of their own.

943
01:32:15,155 --> 01:32:17,391
I was raised in Rivendell...

944
01:32:17,891 --> 01:32:19,266
...for a time.

945
01:32:22,595 --> 01:32:24,700
Turn this fellow free.

946
01:32:25,332 --> 01:32:27,788
He's seen enough of war.

947
01:32:39,546 --> 01:32:42,329
Gandalf the White.

948
01:32:42,584 --> 01:32:44,950
Gandalf the Fool!

949
01:32:46,287 --> 01:32:50,148
Does he seek to humble me
with his newfound piety?

950
01:32:51,524 --> 01:32:55,321
There were three
who followed the wizard.

951
01:32:55,996 --> 01:33:01,047
An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man.

952
01:33:01,602 --> 01:33:04,220
You stink of horse.

953
01:33:09,577 --> 01:33:11,400
The Man...

954
01:33:13,515 --> 01:33:17,671
...was he from Gondor?
- No, from the North.

955
01:33:17,986 --> 01:33:21,662
One of the Dûnedain Rangers,
I thought he was.

956
01:33:21,990 --> 01:33:23,713
His cloth was poor.

957
01:33:24,558 --> 01:33:29,610
And yet he bore a strange ring.

958
01:33:30,933 --> 01:33:34,227
Two serpents with emerald eyes.

959
01:33:34,536 --> 01:33:40,165
One devouring,
the other crowned with golden flowers.

960
01:33:40,543 --> 01:33:42,364
The Ring of Barahir.

961
01:33:43,445 --> 01:33:46,926
So Gandalf Greyhame
thinks he has found Isildur's heir.

962
01:33:47,251 --> 01:33:50,382
The lost king of Gondor.
He is a fool.

963
01:33:50,820 --> 01:33:53,339
The line was broken years ago.

964
01:33:54,924 --> 01:33:56,298
It matters not.

965
01:33:56,526 --> 01:33:59,013
The world of Men shall fall.

966
01:33:59,261 --> 01:34:01,085
It will begin at Edoras.

967
01:34:10,273 --> 01:34:12,127
I am ready, Gamling.

968
01:34:12,375 --> 01:34:14,797
Bring my horse.

969
01:34:18,081 --> 01:34:19,325
This is not a defeat.

970
01:34:21,884 --> 01:34:23,029
We will return.

971
01:34:28,458 --> 01:34:30,847
We will return.

972
01:34:54,284 --> 01:34:56,171
You have some skill with a blade.

973
01:35:04,796 --> 01:35:06,770
Women of this country learned long ago:

974
01:35:06,998 --> 01:35:09,420
Those without swords
can still die upon them.

975
01:35:09,834 --> 01:35:11,459
I fear neither death nor pain.

976
01:35:12,904 --> 01:35:14,911
What do you fear, my lady?

977
01:35:18,343 --> 01:35:20,132
A cage.

978
01:35:21,446 --> 01:35:25,155
To stay behind bars until use
and old age accept them.

979
01:35:25,451 --> 01:35:29,225
And all chance of valor has gone
beyond recall or desire.

980
01:35:32,925 --> 01:35:34,833
You're a daughter of kings...

981
01:35:36,161 --> 01:35:39,292
...a shieldmaiden of Rohan.

982
01:35:44,836 --> 01:35:47,171
I do not think that would be your fate.

983
01:36:20,307 --> 01:36:23,176
Théoden will not stay at Edoras.

984
01:36:23,476 --> 01:36:25,451
It's vulnerable. He knows this.

985
01:36:25,879 --> 01:36:28,661
He will expect an attack on the city.

986
01:36:30,051 --> 01:36:33,116
They will flee to Helm's Deep...

987
01:36:33,420 --> 01:36:35,754
...the great fortress of Rohan.

988
01:36:37,023 --> 01:36:41,180
It is a dangerous road to take
through the mountains.

989
01:36:42,896 --> 01:36:44,423
They will be slow.

990
01:36:44,999 --> 01:36:49,189
They will have women and children
with them.

991
01:36:53,239 --> 01:36:55,379
Send out your Warg-riders.

992
01:37:10,324 --> 01:37:13,139
Hey, stinker, don't go getting
too far ahead.

993
01:37:13,395 --> 01:37:15,980
- Why do you do that?
- What?

994
01:37:16,263 --> 01:37:18,751
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.

995
01:37:19,234 --> 01:37:21,175
Because.

996
01:37:22,870 --> 01:37:24,877
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.

997
01:37:25,140 --> 01:37:27,212
There's naught left in him
but lies and deceit.

998
01:37:27,844 --> 01:37:30,363
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.

999
01:37:30,779 --> 01:37:32,917
You have no idea what it did to him...

1000
01:37:33,149 --> 01:37:35,449
...what it's still doing to him.

1001
01:37:37,919 --> 01:37:39,893
I want to help him, Sam.

1002
01:37:40,121 --> 01:37:41,299
Why?

1003
01:37:46,796 --> 01:37:49,762
Because I have to believe
he can come back.

1004
01:37:54,102 --> 01:37:55,956
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.

1005
01:37:56,204 --> 01:37:58,856
What do you know about it?
Nothing!

1006
01:38:05,847 --> 01:38:09,840
I'm sorry, Sam. I don't know
why I said that.

1007
01:38:10,887 --> 01:38:11,967
I do.

1008
01:38:14,057 --> 01:38:15,846
It's the Ring.

1009
01:38:16,427 --> 01:38:17,953
You can't take your eyes off it.

1010
01:38:18,828 --> 01:38:20,716
I've seen you.

1011
01:38:21,198 --> 01:38:24,906
You're not eating. You barely sleep.

1012
01:38:26,870 --> 01:38:28,974
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.

1013
01:38:29,205 --> 01:38:31,857
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.

1014
01:38:32,109 --> 01:38:34,924
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.

1015
01:38:35,212 --> 01:38:36,902
Mine! My own!

1016
01:38:37,848 --> 01:38:39,855
Can't you hear yourself?

1017
01:38:40,084 --> 01:38:41,741
Don't you know who you sound like?

1018
01:38:52,063 --> 01:38:54,069
We wants it.

1019
01:38:54,298 --> 01:38:56,948
We needs it.

1020
01:38:57,201 --> 01:39:01,838
Must have the precious.

1021
01:39:02,206 --> 01:39:05,337
They stole it from us.

1022
01:39:05,810 --> 01:39:08,973
Sneaky little Hobbitses.

1023
01:39:09,246 --> 01:39:13,020
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

1024
01:39:13,317 --> 01:39:16,383
No. Not master.

1025
01:39:16,855 --> 01:39:20,400
Yes, precious. False.

1026
01:39:20,860 --> 01:39:25,082
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!

1027
01:39:26,397 --> 01:39:28,818
Master's my friend.

1028
01:39:29,100 --> 01:39:33,922
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.

1029
01:39:35,374 --> 01:39:37,829
Not listening. I'm not listening.

1030
01:39:38,110 --> 01:39:41,938
You're a liar and a thief.

1031
01:39:42,815 --> 01:39:44,222
No.

1032
01:39:45,216 --> 01:39:47,998
Murderer.

1033
01:39:50,523 --> 01:39:51,471
Go away.

1034
01:39:51,857 --> 01:39:54,061
Go away?

1035
01:39:56,162 --> 01:39:58,879
I hate you.

1036
01:39:59,131 --> 01:40:01,367
I hate you.

1037
01:40:01,901 --> 01:40:05,000
Where would you be without me?
Gollum. Gollum.

1038
01:40:05,304 --> 01:40:07,093
I saved us.

1039
01:40:07,307 --> 01:40:11,714
It was me. We survived because of me.

1040
01:40:13,079 --> 01:40:16,427
Not anymore.

1041
01:40:18,050 --> 01:40:19,457
What did you say?

1042
01:40:21,588 --> 01:40:25,296
Master looks after us now.

1043
01:40:25,592 --> 01:40:29,007
We don't need you.

1044
01:40:29,929 --> 01:40:31,337
What?

1045
01:40:31,531 --> 01:40:33,254
Leave now...

1046
01:40:33,500 --> 01:40:37,177
...and never come back.

1047
01:40:37,471 --> 01:40:38,419
No.

1048
01:40:39,073 --> 01:40:43,066
Leave now and never come back.

1049
01:40:45,913 --> 01:40:51,609
Leave now and never come back!

1050
01:41:03,797 --> 01:41:06,252
We told him to go away.

1051
01:41:06,499 --> 01:41:09,369
And away he goes, precious.

1052
01:41:09,805 --> 01:41:11,527
Gone! Gone! Gone!

1053
01:41:11,939 --> 01:41:13,727
Sméagol is free!

1054
01:41:18,545 --> 01:41:20,040
Look.

1055
01:41:20,248 --> 01:41:24,656
Look. See what Sméagol finds?

1056
01:41:34,296 --> 01:41:35,572
They are young.

1057
01:41:35,964 --> 01:41:38,297
They are tender. They are nice.

1058
01:41:38,532 --> 01:41:41,980
Yes, they are. Eat them. Eat them!

1059
01:41:44,907 --> 01:41:46,336
You'll make him sick, you will...

1060
01:41:47,576 --> 01:41:49,812
...behaving like that.

1061
01:41:52,247 --> 01:41:54,965
There's only one way to eat
a brace of coneys.

1062
01:41:59,255 --> 01:42:00,815
What's it doing?

1063
01:42:01,456 --> 01:42:04,009
Stupid, fat Hobbit.

1064
01:42:04,259 --> 01:42:06,331
It ruins it.

1065
01:42:06,595 --> 01:42:10,107
What's to ruin? There's hardly any meat
on them.

1066
01:42:14,404 --> 01:42:16,924
What we need is a few good taters.

1067
01:42:17,941 --> 01:42:20,842
What's taters, precious?

1068
01:42:21,144 --> 01:42:22,835
What's taters? Eh?

1069
01:42:23,046 --> 01:42:24,769
Po-ta-toes.

1070
01:42:25,114 --> 01:42:28,180
Boil them, mash them,
stick them in a stew.

1071
01:42:29,919 --> 01:42:35,101
Lovely, big, golden chips
with a nice piece of fried fish.

1072
01:42:36,592 --> 01:42:38,414
Even you couldn't say no to that.

1073
01:42:38,962 --> 01:42:41,001
Oh, yes, we could.

1074
01:42:41,263 --> 01:42:44,679
Spoil a nice fish.

1075
01:42:46,070 --> 01:42:48,491
Give it to us raw...

1076
01:42:48,905 --> 01:42:51,807
...and wriggling.

1077
01:42:52,076 --> 01:42:55,043
You keep nasty chips.

1078
01:42:56,146 --> 01:42:58,089
You're hopeless.

1079
01:43:10,594 --> 01:43:12,088
Mr. Frodo?

1080
01:43:30,082 --> 01:43:32,699
- Who are they?
- Wicked Men.

1081
01:43:32,951 --> 01:43:35,253
Servants of Sauron.

1082
01:43:36,188 --> 01:43:38,259
They are called to Mordor.

1083
01:43:38,489 --> 01:43:41,391
The Dark One is gathering all armies
to him.

1084
01:43:41,826 --> 01:43:44,825
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.

1085
01:43:46,465 --> 01:43:50,010
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.

1086
01:43:50,336 --> 01:43:55,256
The last war that will cover
all the world in Shadow.

1087
01:43:55,874 --> 01:43:58,776
We've got to get moving. Come on, Sam.

1088
01:43:59,045 --> 01:44:00,190
Mr. Frodo.

1089
01:44:00,847 --> 01:44:02,275
Look.

1090
01:44:05,985 --> 01:44:08,156
It's an oliphaunt.

1091
01:44:16,429 --> 01:44:19,299
No one at home will believe this.

1092
01:44:30,576 --> 01:44:32,400
Sméagol?

1093
01:45:12,920 --> 01:45:15,221
We've lingered here too long.

1094
01:45:18,326 --> 01:45:19,536
Come on, Sam.

1095
01:45:33,174 --> 01:45:35,826
Wait! We're innocent travelers!

1096
01:45:37,513 --> 01:45:42,400
There are no travelers in this land.
Only servants of the Dark Tower.

1097
01:45:42,918 --> 01:45:45,732
We are bound to an errand of secrecy.

1098
01:45:47,156 --> 01:45:50,319
Those that claim to oppose the enemy
would do well not to hinder us.

1099
01:45:50,592 --> 01:45:52,730
The enemy?

1100
01:45:54,898 --> 01:45:58,158
His sense of duty was no less
than yours, I deem.

1101
01:46:00,836 --> 01:46:02,778
You wonder what his name is...

1102
01:46:04,307 --> 01:46:06,445
...where he came from.

1103
01:46:08,510 --> 01:46:10,932
And if he was really evil at heart.

1104
01:46:12,782 --> 01:46:16,010
What lies or threats led him
on this long march from home.

1105
01:46:17,853 --> 01:46:20,122
If he would not rather have stayed there...

1106
01:46:22,391 --> 01:46:23,920
...in peace.

1107
01:46:27,463 --> 01:46:30,365
War will make corpses of us all.

1108
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:32,774
Bind their hands.

1109
01:46:38,945 --> 01:46:41,563
It's true, you don't see
many Dwarf women.

1110
01:46:41,848 --> 01:46:45,361
And in fact, they are so alike
in voice and appearance...

1111
01:46:45,685 --> 01:46:48,718
...that they're often mistaken
for Dwarf men.

1112
01:46:49,289 --> 01:46:51,111
It's the beards.

1113
01:46:51,391 --> 01:46:53,397
This, in turn, has given rise
to the belief...

1114
01:46:53,694 --> 01:46:56,443
...that there are no Dwarf women...

1115
01:46:56,730 --> 01:47:00,822
...and that Dwarves just spring out
of holes in the ground...

1116
01:47:02,669 --> 01:47:04,457
...which is, of course, ridiculous.

1117
01:47:10,644 --> 01:47:12,815
It's all right. Nobody panic.

1118
01:47:13,347 --> 01:47:15,322
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.

1119
01:47:17,284 --> 01:47:20,929
I haven't seen my niece smile
for a long time.

1120
01:47:21,421 --> 01:47:24,040
She was a girl when they brought
her father back dead.

1121
01:47:24,359 --> 01:47:26,530
Cut down by Orcs.

1122
01:47:26,827 --> 01:47:29,676
She watched her mother
succumb to grief.

1123
01:47:30,431 --> 01:47:34,872
Then she was left alone,
to tend her king in growing fear.

1124
01:47:35,236 --> 01:47:39,611
Doomed to wait upon an old man,
who should have loved her as a father.

1125
01:47:49,785 --> 01:47:52,054
Gimli.

1126
01:47:52,354 --> 01:47:54,296
No, I couldn't.

1127
01:47:54,557 --> 01:47:56,344
I really couldn't.

1128
01:48:00,929 --> 01:48:02,457
I made some stew.

1129
01:48:02,731 --> 01:48:05,862
It isn't much, but it's hot.

1130
01:48:13,809 --> 01:48:15,783
Thank you.

1131
01:48:36,366 --> 01:48:38,787
- It's good.
- Really?

1132
01:48:42,872 --> 01:48:46,102
My uncle told me a strange thing.

1133
01:48:47,544 --> 01:48:51,439
He said that you rode to war
with Thengel, my grandfather.

1134
01:48:52,015 --> 01:48:54,382
But he must be mistaken.

1135
01:48:54,752 --> 01:48:58,975
King Théoden has a good memory.
He was only a small child at the time.

1136
01:49:00,324 --> 01:49:03,357
Then you must be at least 60.

1137
01:49:05,629 --> 01:49:07,091
Seventy?

1138
01:49:07,631 --> 01:49:09,225
But you cannot be 80!

1139
01:49:12,636 --> 01:49:13,946
Eighty-seven.

1140
01:49:17,108 --> 01:49:19,116
You are one of the Dûnedain.

1141
01:49:20,277 --> 01:49:23,245
A descendant of Nûmenor,
blessed with long life.

1142
01:49:24,583 --> 01:49:27,135
It was said that your race
had passed into legend.

1143
01:49:27,886 --> 01:49:29,576
There are few of us left.

1144
01:49:29,820 --> 01:49:32,471
The Northern Kingdom
was destroyed long ago.

1145
01:49:33,393 --> 01:49:36,621
I'm sorry. Please, eat.

1146
01:49:51,444 --> 01:49:55,404
<i>The light of the Evenstar
does not wax and wane.</i>

1147
01:49:56,349 --> 01:49:59,664
It is mine to give to whom I will.

1148
01:50:01,620 --> 01:50:03,922
Like my heart.

1149
01:50:05,491 --> 01:50:07,244
Go to sleep.

Let her go.

1175

Let her take the ship into the west.

Let her bear away her love for you

Nothing more.

1247
02:03:16,241 --> 02:03:17,703
My lady.

1248
02:03:21,480 --> 02:03:23,651
Lord Aragorn...

1249
02:03:23,916 --> 02:03:25,094
...where is he?

1250
02:03:27,186 --> 02:03:28,615
He fell.

Draw all our forces behind the wall.

1254
02:03:54,481 --> 02:03:57,296
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.

1255
02:03:57,651 --> 02:04:00,619
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
The women and children?

1256
02:04:00,922 --> 02:04:03,409
Get them into the caves.

1257
02:04:04,423 --> 02:04:09,094
Saruman's arm will have grown long
indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.

1258
02:04:11,331 --> 02:04:14,592
Helm 's Deep has one weakness.

1259
02:04:14,902 --> 02:04:17,138
Its outer wall is solid rock...

1260
02:04:17,404 --> 02:04:20,373
...but for a small culvert
at its base...

1261
02:04:20,675 --> 02:04:23,325
...which is little more than a drain.

1262
02:04:26,280 --> 02:04:30,274
How? How can fire undo stone?

1263
02:04:30,619 --> 02:04:34,929
What kind of device
could bring down the wall?

1264
02:04:38,760 --> 02:04:42,555
If the wall is breached,
Helm's Deep will fall.

1265
02:04:42,931 --> 02:04:46,313
Even if it is breached, it would take
a number beyond reckoning...

1266
02:04:46,634 --> 02:04:49,090
...thousands, to storm the Keep.

1267
02:04:49,371 --> 02:04:50,745
Tens of thousands.

1268
02:04:50,973 --> 02:04:54,868

A new power is rising.

1271
02:05:10,259 --> 02:05:13,106
Its victory is at hand.

1272
02:05:18,935 --> 02:05:20,908
This night...

1273
02:05:21,438 --> 02:05:25,594
...the land will be stained
with the blood of Rohan!

1274
02:05:25,941 --> 02:05:29,138
March to Helm's Deep!

1275
02:05:29,445 --> 02:05:32,741
Leave none alive!

1276
02:05:35,385 --> 02:05:37,774
To war!

1277
02:05:41,792 --> 02:05:46,070
There will be no dawn for Men.

1278
02:06:03,479 --> 02:06:05,454
Look. There's smoke to the south.

1279
02:06:05,716 --> 02:06:08,750
There is always smoke rising...

1280
02:06:09,087 --> 02:06:12,763
...from Isengard these days.

1281
02:06:13,190 --> 02:06:14,684
Isengard?

1282
02:06:14,993 --> 02:06:16,748
There was a time...

1283
02:06:17,195 --> 02:06:20,543
...when Saruman would walk in my woods.

1284
02:06:20,898 --> 02:06:24,128
But now he has a mind of metal...

1285
02:06:24,937 --> 02:06:27,270
...and wheels.

1286
02:06:28,139 --> 02:06:32,449
He no longer cares for growing things.

1287
02:06:32,811 --> 02:06:34,534
What is it?

1288
02:06:39,584 --> 02:06:41,722
It's Saruman's army.

1289

The war has started.

What news?

Our scouts report Saruman
has attacked Rohan.

Théoden's people have fled

But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.

Sauron is marshaling an army.

02:14:50,358 --> 02:14:52,399
Easterlings and Southrons
are at the Black Gate.

1376
02:14:52,660 --> 02:14:55,922
- How many?
- Some thousands. More come every day.

1377
02:14:57,166 --> 02:15:00,582

- We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.

If their city is attacked,
we won't hold it.

Saruman attacks from Isengard.

Sauron from Mordor.

1381
02:15:12,481 --> 02:15:15,547
The fight will come to Men
on both fronts.

1382

Gondor is weak.

1383
02:15:17,753 --> 02:15:20,753
Sauron will strike us soon.

1384
02:15:21,624 --> 02:15:23,413
And he will strike hard.

1385
02:15:23,926 --> 02:15:27,854
He knows now we do not have
the strength to repel him.

1386
02:15:41,878 --> 02:15:44,017
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.

1387
02:15:44,315 --> 02:15:46,900
Spies? Now wait just a minute.

1388
02:15:47,216 --> 02:15:49,388
Well, if you're not spies,
then who are you?

1389
02:15:56,359 --> 02:15:58,018
Speak.

1390
02:15:59,196 --> 02:16:01,683
We are Hobbits of the Shire.

1391
02:16:02,133 --> 02:16:05,035
Frodo Baggins is my name,
and this is Samwise Gamgee.

1392
02:16:05,568 --> 02:16:07,030
Your bodyguard?

1393
02:16:07,271 --> 02:16:08,994
His gardener.

1394
02:16:09,674 --> 02:16:11,584
And where is your skulking friend?

1395
02:16:13,177 --> 02:16:15,413
That gangrel creature.

1396
02:16:15,812 --> 02:16:17,701
He had an ill-favored look.

1397
02:16:19,517 --> 02:16:21,372
There was no other.

1398
02:16:25,555 --> 02:16:27,792
We set out from Rivendell
with seven companions.

1399
02:16:31,229 --> 02:16:34,163
One we lost in Moria...

1400
02:16:35,367 --> 02:16:36,828
...two were my kin...

1401
02:16:37,068 --> 02:16:40,647
...a Dwarf there was also.
And an Elf and two Men.

1402
02:16:40,972 --> 02:16:44,715
Aragorn, son of Arathorn,
and Boromir of Gondor.

1403
02:16:49,881 --> 02:16:51,572
You're a friend of Boromir?

1404
02:16:54,119 --> 02:16:55,527
Yes.

1405
02:16:56,688 --> 02:16:57,703
For my part.

1406
02:17:04,298 --> 02:17:07,112
It will grieve you then to learn
that he is dead.

1407
02:17:09,268 --> 02:17:10,674
Dead?

1408
02:17:10,903 --> 02:17:12,876
How? When?

1409
02:17:13,207 --> 02:17:15,759
As one of his companions,
I'd hoped you would tell me.

1410
02:17:16,175 --> 02:17:19,852
If something has happened to Boromir,
we would have you tell us.

1411
02:17:22,750 --> 02:17:28,947
His horn washed up upon the riverbank,
about six days past.

1412
02:17:29,456 --> 02:17:32,423
It was cloven in two.

1413
02:17:34,160 --> 02:17:37,422
But more than this, I know it in my heart.

1414
02:17:39,599 --> 02:17:41,323
He was my brother.

1415
02:18:30,352 --> 02:18:33,166
Boromir!

1416
02:18:33,855 --> 02:18:35,644
Boromir!

1417
02:18:39,961 --> 02:18:43,574
This city was once the jewel
of our kingdom.

1418
02:18:43,900 --> 02:18:47,412
A place of light and beauty and music.

1419
02:18:47,736 --> 02:18:49,973
And so it shall be once more!

1420
02:18:52,608 --> 02:18:55,162
Let the armies of Mordor know this:

1421
02:18:55,444 --> 02:18:59,635
Never again will the land of my people
fall into enemy hands.

1422
02:19:03,620 --> 02:19:09,086
This city of Osgiliath
has been reclaimed for Gondor!

1423
02:19:09,693 --> 02:19:11,580
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!

1424
02:19:11,828 --> 02:19:14,545
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!

1425
02:19:23,373 --> 02:19:26,025
Good speech. Nice and short.

1426
02:19:26,311 --> 02:19:29,092
Leaves more time for drinking!

1427
02:19:29,513 --> 02:19:33,540
Break out the ale! These men are thirsty!

1428
02:19:37,188 --> 02:19:39,228
Remember today, little brother.

1429
02:19:39,524 --> 02:19:42,393
Today, life is good.

1430
02:19:46,697 --> 02:19:48,224
What?

1431
02:19:48,667 --> 02:19:50,074
He's here.

1432
02:19:53,337 --> 02:19:54,899
One moment of peace,
can he not give us that?

1433
02:19:55,140 --> 02:19:56,317
Where is he?

1434
02:19:56,541 --> 02:19:59,858
Where is Gondor's finest?
Where's my first-born?

1435
02:20:00,545 --> 02:20:02,204
Father!

1436
02:20:07,119 --> 02:20:09,421
They say you vanquished the enemy
almost single-handedly.

1437
02:20:09,656 --> 02:20:12,951
They exaggerate.
The victory belongs to Faramir also.

1438
02:20:14,561 --> 02:20:17,343
But for Faramir, this city
would still be standing.

1439
02:20:18,263 --> 02:20:20,467
Were you not entrusted to protect it?

1440
02:20:20,732 --> 02:20:22,674
I would have done,
but our numbers were too few.

1441
02:20:22,935 --> 02:20:24,562
Oh, too few.

1442
02:20:25,138 --> 02:20:27,439
You let the enemy walk in
and take it on a whim.

1443
02:20:29,742 --> 02:20:32,612
Always you cast a poor reflection on me.

1444
02:20:32,911 --> 02:20:35,082
That is not my intent.

1445
02:20:35,348 --> 02:20:38,959
You give him no credit,
and yet he tries to do your will.

1446
02:20:42,522 --> 02:20:45,304
- He loves you, Father.
- Do not trouble me with Faramir...

1447
02:20:45,558 --> 02:20:48,242
...I know his uses, and they are few.

1448
02:20:48,528 --> 02:20:51,976
We have more urgent things to speak of.

1449
02:20:53,300 --> 02:20:55,634
Elrond of Rivendell has called a meeting.

1450
02:20:55,903 --> 02:20:58,653
He will not say why,
but I have guessed its purpose.

1451
02:20:58,939 --> 02:21:02,583
It is rumored that the weapon
of the enemy has been found.

1452
02:21:04,945 --> 02:21:07,149
The One Ring.

1453
02:21:09,983 --> 02:21:14,456
- Isildur's Bane.
- It has fallen into the hands of the Elves.

1454
02:21:14,822 --> 02:21:18,303
Everyone will try to claim it:
Men, Dwarves, wizards.

1455
02:21:18,627 --> 02:21:22,588
We cannot let that happen.
This thing must come to Gondor.

1456
02:21:24,597 --> 02:21:27,151
- Gondor.
- It's dangerous, I know.

1457
02:21:27,435 --> 02:21:30,980
Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt
the hearts of lesser Men.

1458
02:21:31,305 --> 02:21:35,048
But you, you are strong.
And our need is great.

1459
02:21:35,377 --> 02:21:40,462
It is our blood which is being spilled,
our people who are dying.

1460
02:21:40,849 --> 02:21:45,705
Sauron is biding his time.
He's massing fresh armies.

1461
02:21:46,087 --> 02:21:47,516
He will return.

1462
02:21:47,756 --> 02:21:51,367
And when he does,
we will be powerless to stop him.

1463
02:21:51,660 --> 02:21:54,116
You must go.

1464
02:21:55,431 --> 02:21:57,438
Bring me back this mighty gift.

1465
02:21:58,367 --> 02:22:03,637
No. My place is here with my people.
Not in Rivendell.

1466
02:22:04,040 --> 02:22:07,586
- Would you deny your own father?
- If there is need to go to Rivendell...

1467
02:22:07,911 --> 02:22:10,757
...send me in his stead.
- You?

1468
02:22:12,049 --> 02:22:13,903
Oh, I see.

1469
02:22:14,151 --> 02:22:18,176
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor,
to show his quality.

1470
02:22:18,789 --> 02:22:20,697
I think not.

1471
02:22:20,957 --> 02:22:23,707
I trust this mission only to your brother.

1472
02:22:24,026 --> 02:22:26,809
The one who will not fail me.

1473
02:22:44,014 --> 02:22:47,047
Remember today, little brother.

1474
02:23:05,569 --> 02:23:07,456
Captain Faramir!

1475
02:23:08,839 --> 02:23:10,880
We found the third one.

1476
02:23:22,453 --> 02:23:24,363
You must come with me. Now.

1477
02:23:35,667 --> 02:23:36,681
Down there.

1478
02:23:51,683 --> 02:23:54,433
To enter the Forbidden Pool
bears the penalty of death.

1479
02:24:05,198 --> 02:24:06,606
They wait for my command.

1480
02:24:12,172 --> 02:24:13,219
Shall I shoot?

1481
02:24:14,507 --> 02:24:17,409
<i>The rock and pool
Is nice and cool</i>

1482
02:24:17,710 --> 02:24:19,465
<i>So juicy sweet</i>

1483
02:24:20,181 --> 02:24:23,028
<i>Our only wish
To catch a fish</i>

1484
02:24:23,316 --> 02:24:25,902
<i>So juicy sweet</i>

1485
02:24:32,959 --> 02:24:34,301
Wait.

1486
02:24:35,863 --> 02:24:38,580
This creature is bound to me.

1487
02:24:39,333 --> 02:24:41,188
And I to him.

1488
02:24:44,538 --> 02:24:45,783
He is our guide.

1489
02:24:50,578 --> 02:24:51,920
Please...

1490
02:24:52,146 --> 02:24:53,935
...let me go down to him.

1491
02:25:05,293 --> 02:25:06,885
Sméagol.

1492
02:25:07,963 --> 02:25:10,101
Master is here.

1493
02:25:11,433 --> 02:25:12,481
Come, Sméagol.

1494
02:25:15,437 --> 02:25:17,958
Trust master. Come.

1495
02:25:21,244 --> 02:25:24,920
We must go now?

1496
02:25:25,448 --> 02:25:28,743
Sméagol, you must trust master.

1497
02:25:29,050 --> 02:25:30,392
Follow me. Come on.

1498
02:25:31,654 --> 02:25:33,115
Come.

1499
02:25:35,691 --> 02:25:36,837
Come, Sméagol.

1500
02:25:37,393 --> 02:25:39,367
Nice Sméagol. That's it.

1501
02:25:39,962 --> 02:25:41,425
Come on.

1502
02:25:45,936 --> 02:25:47,496
Don't hurt him!

1503
02:25:47,770 --> 02:25:50,389
Sméagol, don't struggle.
Sméagol, listen to me.

1504
02:25:50,674 --> 02:25:51,917
Master!

1505
02:26:17,200 --> 02:26:19,437
That's enough.

1506
02:26:23,205 --> 02:26:25,278
Where are you leading them?

1507
02:26:27,177 --> 02:26:28,771
Answer me.

1508
02:26:29,646 --> 02:26:32,745
Sméagol.

1509
02:26:36,321 --> 02:26:40,893
Why does it cry, Sméagol?

1510
02:26:42,327 --> 02:26:44,848
Cruel Men hurts us.

1511
02:26:45,129 --> 02:26:47,999
Master tricksed us.

1512
02:26:48,334 --> 02:26:51,715
Of course he did.

1513
02:26:52,270 --> 02:26:55,783
I told you he was tricksy.

1514
02:26:56,140 --> 02:26:59,043
I told you he was false.

1515
02:26:59,344 --> 02:27:01,931
Master is our friend.

1516
02:27:02,215 --> 02:27:04,483
Our friend.

1517
02:27:04,750 --> 02:27:06,823
Master betrayed us.

1518
02:27:07,086 --> 02:27:09,955
No. Not its business.

1519
02:27:11,157 --> 02:27:13,491
Leave us alone!

1520
02:27:13,760 --> 02:27:16,062
Filthy little Hobbitses!

1521
02:27:16,329 --> 02:27:18,532
They stole it from us!

1522
02:27:18,797 --> 02:27:20,171
No. No.

1523
02:27:20,800 --> 02:27:22,360
What did they steal?

1524
02:27:24,603 --> 02:27:29,720
My precious!

1525
02:27:33,580 --> 02:27:35,140
We have to get out of here.

1526
02:27:35,815 --> 02:27:37,702
You go. Go, now.

1527
02:27:40,388 --> 02:27:42,176
You can do it.

1528
02:27:43,690 --> 02:27:45,097
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.

1529
02:27:45,325 --> 02:27:47,049
Just this once.

1530
02:27:47,294 --> 02:27:48,984
Put it on.

1531
02:27:49,497 --> 02:27:51,439
Disappear.

1532
02:27:52,565 --> 02:27:53,613
I can't.

1533
02:27:56,737 --> 02:27:58,876
You were right, Sam.

1534
02:28:00,442 --> 02:28:02,808
You tried to tell me but...

1535
02:28:07,648 --> 02:28:09,721
I'm sorry.

1536
02:28:14,356 --> 02:28:17,105
The Ring's taking me, Sam.

1537
02:28:18,627 --> 02:28:20,219
If I put it on...

1538
02:28:20,462 --> 02:28:22,699
...he'll find me.

1539
02:28:24,465 --> 02:28:26,353
He'll see.

1540
02:28:27,669 --> 02:28:29,556
Mr. Frodo...

1541
02:28:34,543 --> 02:28:38,635
So this is the answer
to all the riddles.

1542
02:28:41,016 --> 02:28:43,886
Here in the Wild I have you...

1543
02:28:44,186 --> 02:28:46,009
...two Halflings...

1544
02:28:46,255 --> 02:28:49,288
...and a host of men at my call.

1545
02:28:52,728 --> 02:28:56,077
The Ring of Power within my grasp.

1546
02:28:56,970 --> 02:29:09,259
<i><font color="#0080C0">♫ I tuo i macil a staldaron Corma</font></i>
<i><font color="#FFFF00">(The strength, the weapon, the needs of the valiant, the Ring...)</font></i>

1547
02:29:05,942 --> 02:29:09,486
A chance for Faramir,
captain of Gondor...

1548
02:29:11,280 --> 02:29:14,182
...to show his quality.

1549
02:29:35,406 --> 02:29:36,900
No!

1550
02:29:40,177 --> 02:29:41,454
Stop it!

1551
02:29:41,679 --> 02:29:42,660
Leave him alone.

1552
02:29:44,082 --> 02:29:46,448
Don't you understand?

1553
02:29:47,885 --> 02:29:49,707
He's got to destroy it!

1554
02:29:49,953 --> 02:29:53,053
That's where we're going, into Mordor.

1555
02:29:53,358 --> 02:29:54,951
To the Mountain of Fire!

1556
02:29:56,093 --> 02:29:59,061
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.

1557
02:29:59,364 --> 02:30:02,234
Please. It's such a burden.

1558
02:30:04,536 --> 02:30:06,543
Will you not help him?

1559
02:30:07,972 --> 02:30:09,794
Captain?

1560
02:30:10,576 --> 02:30:12,681
Prepare to leave.

1561
02:30:17,750 --> 02:30:20,084
The Ring will go to Gondor.

1562
02:31:20,500 --> 02:31:25,450
<font color="#008000">Mae carnen, Brego, mellon nîn.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">(Well done, Brego, my friend.)</font>

1563
02:31:33,127 --> 02:31:35,648
- He's alive!
- Where is he? Where is he?

1564
02:31:35,930 --> 02:31:38,865
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!

1565
02:31:39,167 --> 02:31:42,779
You are the luckiest, the canniest...

1566
02:31:43,105 --> 02:31:46,967
...and the most reckless man
I ever knew.

1567
02:31:47,809 --> 02:31:49,238
Bless you, laddie.

1568
02:31:49,877 --> 02:31:51,536
Gimli, where is the king?

1569
02:32:00,689 --> 02:32:01,637
<font color="#008000">Le abdollen.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">(You’re late.)</font>

1570
02:32:05,428 --> 02:32:06,704
You look terrible.

1571
02:32:33,800 --> 02:32:36,800
<font color="#008000">Hannon le.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">(Thank you.)</font>

1572
02:32:48,472 --> 02:32:50,446
A great host, you say?

1573
02:32:50,708 --> 02:32:53,261
- All Isengard is emptied.
- How many?

1574
02:32:54,044 --> 02:32:56,914
Ten thousand strong at least.

1575
02:32:58,581 --> 02:32:59,988
Ten thousand?

1576
02:33:00,483 --> 02:33:02,850
It is an army bred for a single purpose:

1577
02:33:05,656 --> 02:33:07,696
To destroy the world of Men.

1578
02:33:10,294 --> 02:33:12,203
They will be here by nightfall.

1579
02:33:18,136 --> 02:33:19,380
Let them come!

1580
02:33:20,937 --> 02:33:23,589
I want every man and strong lad
able to bear arms...

1581
02:33:23,875 --> 02:33:26,875
...to be ready for battle by nightfall.

1582
02:33:35,220 --> 02:33:38,035
We will cover the causeway
and the gate from above.

1583
02:33:38,323 --> 02:33:40,658
No army has ever breached
the Deeping Wall...

1584
02:33:40,925 --> 02:33:43,542
...or set foot inside the Hornburg!

1585
02:33:43,828 --> 02:33:46,130
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.

1586
02:33:46,831 --> 02:33:48,936
These are Uruk-hai.

1587
02:33:49,201 --> 02:33:52,496
Their armour is thick
and their shields broad.

1588
02:33:54,272 --> 02:33:57,785
I have fought many wars,
Master Dwarf.

1589
02:33:58,110 --> 02:34:01,558
I know how to defend my own keep.

1590
02:34:08,353 --> 02:34:11,616
They will break upon this fortress
like water on rock.

1591
02:34:11,925 --> 02:34:16,943
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.

1592
02:34:17,362 --> 02:34:19,917
Crops can be resown...

1593
02:34:20,200 --> 02:34:23,070
...homes rebuilt.

1594
02:34:23,803 --> 02:34:26,258
Within these walls...

1595
02:34:26,740 --> 02:34:28,169
...we will outlast them.

1596
02:34:28,408 --> 02:34:30,709
They do not come to destroy Rohan's
crops or villages.

1597
02:34:30,977 --> 02:34:32,471
They come to destroy its people...

1598
02:34:32,647 --> 02:34:35,035
...down to the last child.

1599
02:34:36,016 --> 02:34:38,188
What would you have me do?

1600
02:34:38,486 --> 02:34:40,111
Look at my men.

1601
02:34:40,388 --> 02:34:42,046
Their courage hangs by a thread.

1602
02:34:44,324 --> 02:34:48,547
If this is to be our end, then I would
have them make such an end...

1603
02:34:48,895 --> 02:34:51,798
...as to be worthy of remembrance.

1604
02:34:55,569 --> 02:34:57,392
Send out riders, my lord.

1605
02:34:57,771 --> 02:35:00,521
You must call for aid.

1606
02:35:03,911 --> 02:35:06,083
And who will come?

1607
02:35:06,581 --> 02:35:08,108
Elves?

1608
02:35:08,382 --> 02:35:10,324
Dwarves?

1609
02:35:11,219 --> 02:35:13,969
We are not so lucky in our friends
as you.

1610
02:35:14,922 --> 02:35:17,094
The old alliances are dead.

1611
02:35:17,626 --> 02:35:20,310
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?!

1612
02:35:20,596 --> 02:35:22,701
Where was Gondor
when the Westfold fell?!

1613
02:35:23,764 --> 02:35:26,863
Where was Gondor when
our enemies closed in around us?!

1614
02:35:27,170 --> 02:35:29,023
Where was Gon...?

1615
02:35:31,773 --> 02:35:33,561
No, my Lord Aragorn...

1616
02:35:35,245 --> 02:35:37,611
...we are alone.

1617
02:35:44,586 --> 02:35:46,277
Get the women and children
into the caves.

1618
02:35:46,523 --> 02:35:47,701
We need more time
to lay provisions...

1619
02:35:47,956 --> 02:35:51,305
There is no time. War is upon us.

1620
02:35:51,727 --> 02:35:53,354
Secure the gate.

1621
02:35:58,636 --> 02:36:00,642
We Ents have not troubled...

1622
02:36:00,937 --> 02:36:04,166
...about the wars of Men and wizards...

1623
02:36:05,074 --> 02:36:07,922
...for a very long time.

1624
02:36:09,312 --> 02:36:13,883
But now, something
is about to happen...

1625
02:36:14,250 --> 02:36:16,487
...that has not happened...

1626
02:36:16,787 --> 02:36:19,176
...for an age.

1627
02:36:20,490 --> 02:36:22,629
Entmoot.

1628
02:36:23,192 --> 02:36:24,120
What's that?

1629
02:36:24,595 --> 02:36:27,312
'Tis a gathering.

1630
02:36:28,632 --> 02:36:31,088
A gathering of what?

1631
02:36:36,970 --> 02:36:58,459
<i><font color="#008000">♫ Echuiannen</font></i>
<i><font color="#FFFF00">(The woods have awoken)</font></i>

1632
02:36:49,120 --> 02:36:51,422
Beech. Oak.

1633
02:36:51,655 --> 02:36:53,510
Chestnut. Ash.

1634
02:36:53,858 --> 02:36:55,746
Good. Good. Good.

1635
02:36:55,994 --> 02:36:58,262
Many have come.

1636
02:37:05,904 --> 02:37:08,555
Now we must decide
if the Ents...

1637
02:37:08,841 --> 02:37:11,296
...will go to war.

1638
02:37:20,353 --> 02:37:23,287
Move back! Move to the caves!

1639
02:37:25,925 --> 02:37:27,867
Come on, people! Quicky, now!

1640
02:37:28,394 --> 02:37:30,565
We'll place the reserves along the wall.

1641
02:37:30,863 --> 02:37:33,003
They can support the archers
from above the gate.

1642
02:37:33,266 --> 02:37:36,264
Aragorn, you must rest.

1643
02:37:36,569 --> 02:37:38,871
You're no use to us half alive.

1644
02:37:39,438 --> 02:37:40,583
Aragorn!

1645
02:37:44,043 --> 02:37:46,946
I'm to be sent with the women
into the caves.

1646
02:37:47,247 --> 02:37:48,840
That is an honorable charge.

1647
02:37:49,082 --> 02:37:51,831
To mind the children, to find food
and bedding when the men return.

1648
02:37:52,119 --> 02:37:53,745
What renown is there in that?

1649
02:37:53,987 --> 02:37:57,533
My lady, a time may come for valor
without renown.

1650
02:37:57,991 --> 02:38:00,641
Who then will your people look to
in the last defense?

1651
02:38:00,961 --> 02:38:05,717
- Let me stand at your side.
- It is not in my power to command it.

1652
02:38:06,267 --> 02:38:08,950
You do not command
the others to stay!

1653
02:38:09,236 --> 02:38:12,848
They fight beside you because they
would not be parted from you.

1654
02:38:14,175 --> 02:38:16,281
Because they love you.

1655
02:38:23,484 --> 02:38:24,946
I'm sorry.

1656
02:39:30,920 --> 02:39:34,018
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.

1657
02:39:35,258 --> 02:39:36,950
These are no soldiers.

1658
02:39:39,330 --> 02:39:42,625
- Most have seen too many winters.
- Or too few.

1659
02:39:46,737 --> 02:39:49,518
Look at them. They're frightened.

1660
02:39:49,806 --> 02:39:51,214
I can see it in their eyes.

Let him be.

1669
02:40:26,745 --> 02:40:31,981
Every villager able to wield a sword
has been sent to the armoury.

1670
02:40:36,421 --> 02:40:38,244
My lord?

1671
02:40:40,425 --> 02:40:42,847
Who am I, Gamling?

1672
02:40:46,364 --> 02:40:50,106
You are our king, sire.

1673
02:40:53,272 --> 02:40:56,402
And do you trust your king?

1674
02:40:58,077 --> 02:41:01,110
Your men, my lord...

1675
02:41:01,413 --> 02:41:04,098

It's been going for hours.

They must have decided something
by now.

Decided? No.

1690

...good morning.

Don't be hasty.

Move! Move to the outer wall.

02:43:21,326 --> 02:43:22,601
Give me your sword.

1698
02:43:32,169 --> 02:43:33,216
What is your name?

1699
02:43:33,838 --> 02:43:36,107
Haleth, son of Háma, my lord.

1700
02:43:38,343 --> 02:43:40,862
The men are saying
we will not live out the night.

1701
02:43:42,948 --> 02:43:44,835
They say that it is hopeless.

1702
02:44:02,734 --> 02:44:04,295
This is a good sword.

1703
02:44:06,438 --> 02:44:08,643
Haleth, son of Háma...

1704
02:44:13,113 --> 02:44:15,185
...there is always hope.

1705
02:44:38,205 --> 02:44:41,401
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.

1706
02:44:41,742 --> 02:44:43,203
Forgive me.

1707
02:44:43,476 --> 02:44:44,852
I was wrong to despair.

1708
02:44:48,115 --> 02:44:50,482
<font color="#008000">Ú-moe edaved, Legolas</font>

1709
02:44:54,121 --> 02:44:56,804
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.

1710
02:45:00,361 --> 02:45:02,336
It's a little tight across the chest.

1711
02:45:08,602 --> 02:45:10,489
That is no Orc horn.

1712
02:45:16,277 --> 02:45:18,034
Send for the king.

1713
02:45:18,280 --> 02:45:21,726
- Open the gate!
- Open up the gate!

How is this possible?

1720
02:45:56,186 --> 02:45:59,665
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.

1721
02:45:59,989 --> 02:46:03,088
An alliance once existed
between Elves and Men.

1722
02:46:03,926 --> 02:46:07,985
Long ago we fought and died together.

1723
02:46:10,433 --> 02:46:13,215
We come to honor that allegiance.

You are most welcome.

1726
02:46:29,153 --> 02:46:32,927
We are proud to fight
alongside Men once more.

1727
02:47:06,758 --> 02:47:09,889
You could have picked a better spot.

1728
02:47:14,900 --> 02:47:18,925
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by,
let's hope it lasts the night.

1729
02:47:25,276 --> 02:47:26,968
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.

1730
02:47:27,679 --> 02:47:30,068
Let's hope they last the night.

1731

- What's happening out there?
- Shall I describe it to you?

1734
02:49:15,690 --> 02:49:17,414
Or would you like me to find you a box?

1742
02:50:49,321 --> 02:50:50,598
Did they hit anything?

1743
02:50:51,356 --> 02:50:53,265
Give them a volley.

1744
02:50:53,525 --> 02:50:55,500

1749
02:51:41,642 --> 02:51:44,512
Swords! Swords!

1750
02:52:22,752 --> 02:52:24,791
Legolas! Two already!

1751
02:52:25,087 --> 02:52:27,094
I'm on 17!

1752
02:52:27,390 --> 02:52:29,812
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!

1753
02:52:36,698 --> 02:52:38,356
Nineteen!

1754
02:53:04,428 --> 02:53:05,802
Merry.

1755
02:53:10,267 --> 02:53:13,911
We have just agreed.

1756
02:53:24,081 --> 02:53:25,488
Yes?

1757
02:53:27,051 --> 02:53:31,044
I have told your names to the Entmoot...

1758
02:53:32,390 --> 02:53:35,422
...and we have agreed...

1759
02:53:36,026 --> 02:53:39,855
...you are not Orcs.

1760
02:53:41,799 --> 02:53:43,839
Well, that's good news.

1761
02:53:44,102 --> 02:53:48,063
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?

1762
02:53:48,873 --> 02:53:52,518
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.

1763
02:53:52,844 --> 02:53:54,305
Hasty?

1764
02:53:55,147 --> 02:53:56,969
Our friends are out there.

1765
02:53:57,216 --> 02:54:01,210
They need our help. They cannot
fight this war on their own.

1766
02:54:01,720 --> 02:54:03,891
War? Yes.

1767
02:54:04,188 --> 02:54:05,978
It affects us all.

1768
02:54:06,258 --> 02:54:09,105
Tree, root and twig.

1769
02:54:10,129 --> 02:54:13,959
But you must understand, young Hobbit...

1770
02:54:14,366 --> 02:54:16,220
...it takes a long time...

1771
02:54:16,467 --> 02:54:21,169
...to say anything in Old Entish...

1772
02:54:21,540 --> 02:54:25,598
...and we never say anything...

1773
02:54:25,944 --> 02:54:29,687
...unless it is worth taking...

1774
02:54:30,016 --> 02:54:33,846
...a long time to say.

1775
02:54:34,787 --> 02:54:37,952
Seventeen! Eighteen!

1776
02:54:38,292 --> 02:54:39,273
Nineteen!

1777
02:54:39,927 --> 02:54:41,682

1778
02:54:41,961 --> 02:54:43,521
Twenty-one!

1779
02:54:53,707 --> 02:54:54,617

Is this it?

1783
02:55:06,019 --> 02:55:08,835
Is this is all you can conjure, Saruman?

Brace the gate!

1788
02:56:54,665 --> 02:56:56,837
Hold them! Stand firm!

1789
02:57:04,842 --> 02:57:06,119
Aragorn!

1790
02:57:10,815 --> 02:57:11,960

1793
02:58:00,733 --> 02:58:04,530
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.

1794
02:58:05,472 --> 02:58:09,334
We must weather such things
as we have always done.

1795
02:58:10,309 --> 02:58:12,317
How can that be your decision?!

1796
02:58:13,079 --> 02:58:16,559
This is not our war.

1797
02:58:17,017 --> 02:58:19,122
But you're part of this world!

1798
02:58:23,356 --> 02:58:25,112
Aren't you?!

1799
02:58:29,262 --> 02:58:31,564
You must help. Please.

1800
02:58:32,866 --> 02:58:35,518
You must do something.

1801
02:58:35,937 --> 02:58:40,062
You are young and brave, Master Merry.

1802
02:58:41,441 --> 02:58:45,020
But your part in this tale is over.

1803
02:58:45,346 --> 02:58:47,484
Go back to your home.

1804
02:58:57,491 --> 02:58:59,663
Maybe Treebeard's right.

1805
02:58:59,927 --> 02:59:01,716
We don't belong here, Merry.

1806
02:59:01,963 --> 02:59:04,135
It's too big for us.

1807
02:59:04,433 --> 02:59:06,954
What can we do in the end?

1808
02:59:09,404 --> 02:59:11,891
We've got the Shire.

1809
02:59:12,573 --> 02:59:14,995
Maybe we should go home.

1810
02:59:16,945 --> 02:59:20,043
The fires of Isengard will spread...

1811
02:59:20,350 --> 02:59:25,052
...and the woods of Tuckborough
and Buckland will burn.

1812
02:59:25,421 --> 02:59:26,948
And...

1813
02:59:28,824 --> 02:59:31,759
And all that was once green and good
in this world will be gone.

1814
02:59:35,397 --> 02:59:38,213
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.

1815
02:59:57,854 --> 02:59:59,032
Aragorn!

1816
02:59:59,256 --> 03:00:01,525
Fall back to the Keep!

1817
03:00:01,792 --> 03:00:04,758

We cannot hold much longer!

- Hold them!
- How long do you need?

1833
03:02:21,402 --> 03:02:23,824
As long as you can give me.

Come on. We can take them.

It's a long way.

1839

Toss me.

- I cannot jump the distance!

You'll have to toss me!

1842
03:03:07,050 --> 03:03:08,261
Don't tell the Elf.

1843
03:03:08,851 --> 03:03:10,543
Not a word.

1844
03:03:25,870 --> 03:03:27,244
Shore up the door!

1845
03:03:27,505 --> 03:03:29,481
- Make way!
- Follow me to the barricade.

1846
03:03:29,740 --> 03:03:30,754
Watch our backs!

1847
03:03:34,912 --> 03:03:37,050
- Throw another one over here!
- Higher!

1848
03:04:27,233 --> 03:04:28,575
Hold fast the gate!

1849
03:04:32,805 --> 03:04:35,619
Gimli! Aragorn!
Get out of there!

1850
03:04:40,513 --> 03:04:42,008
Aragorn!

1851
03:05:15,583 --> 03:05:17,917
Pull everybody back.

1852
03:05:18,385 --> 03:05:20,109
Pull them back.

1853
03:05:20,721 --> 03:05:22,128
Fall back!

1854
03:05:22,356 --> 03:05:24,723
Fall back!

1855
03:05:26,026 --> 03:05:27,652
They have broken through!

1856
03:05:27,894 --> 03:05:30,066
The castle is breached. Retreat!

1857
03:05:30,330 --> 03:05:32,469
- Fall back!
- Retreat!

1858
03:05:32,666 --> 03:05:35,154
Hurry! Inside. Get them inside!

1859
03:05:35,435 --> 03:05:37,608
Into the Keep!

1860
03:05:49,184 --> 03:05:53,919
I will leave you at the western borders
of the forest.

1861
03:05:54,222 --> 03:05:58,729
You can make your way north
to your homeland from there.

1862
03:06:04,667 --> 03:06:05,877
Wait! Stop!

1863
03:06:06,836 --> 03:06:08,264
Stop!

1864
03:06:11,441 --> 03:06:13,098
Turn around.

1865
03:06:14,077 --> 03:06:16,662
- Turn around. Take us south.
- South?

1866
03:06:16,945 --> 03:06:21,734
But that will lead you past Isengard.

1867
03:06:22,318 --> 03:06:24,872
Yes. Exactly.

1868
03:06:25,188 --> 03:06:28,286
If we go south, we can slip
past Saruman unnoticed.

1869
03:06:28,590 --> 03:06:31,143
The closer we are to danger,
the farther we are from harm.

1870
03:06:31,428 --> 03:06:33,337
It's the last thing he'll expect.

1871
03:06:36,032 --> 03:06:38,933
That doesn't make sense to me.

1872
03:06:39,236 --> 03:06:40,348
But then...

1873
03:06:40,571 --> 03:06:43,155
...you are very small.

1874
03:06:43,740 --> 03:06:45,431
Perhaps you're right.

1875
03:06:48,144 --> 03:06:49,607
South it is, then.

1876
03:06:51,214 --> 03:06:54,411
Hold on, little Shirelings.

1877
03:06:56,654 --> 03:06:59,337
I always like going south.

1878
03:06:59,623 --> 03:07:03,747
Somehow it feels like going downhill.

1879
03:07:04,528 --> 03:07:06,894
Are you mad? We'll be caught.

1880
03:07:07,164 --> 03:07:09,019
No, we won't.

1881
03:07:09,834 --> 03:07:12,005
Not this time.

1882
03:07:18,742 --> 03:07:19,724
Look!

1883
03:07:21,413 --> 03:07:23,748
Osgiliath burns!

1884
03:07:24,015 --> 03:07:25,421
Mordor has come.

1885
03:07:26,617 --> 03:07:28,887
The Ring will not save Gondor.

1886
03:07:30,355 --> 03:07:32,461
It has only the power to destroy.

1887
03:07:33,391 --> 03:07:34,765
Please...

1888
03:07:34,993 --> 03:07:36,553
...let me go.

1889
03:07:37,662 --> 03:07:39,189
Hurry.

1890
03:07:42,734 --> 03:07:44,076
Faramir!

1891
03:07:44,303 --> 03:07:46,692
You must let me go!

1892
03:07:47,240 --> 03:07:50,536
And those little family of field mice...

1893
03:07:50,844 --> 03:07:53,560
...that climb up sometimes,
and they tickle me awfully.

1894
03:07:54,412 --> 03:07:57,577
They're always trying to get somewhere
where they...

1895
03:08:08,928 --> 03:08:11,743
Many of these trees were my friends.

1896
03:08:12,565 --> 03:08:17,006
Creatures I had known
from nut and acorn.

1897
03:08:18,371 --> 03:08:19,517
I'm sorry, Treebeard.

1898
03:08:19,741 --> 03:08:22,391
They had voices of their own.

1899
03:08:24,745 --> 03:08:27,200
Saruman.

1900
03:08:27,680 --> 03:08:30,583
A wizard should know better!

1901
03:08:44,965 --> 03:08:48,445
There is no curse in Elvish...

1902
03:08:48,803 --> 03:08:51,355
...Entish or the tongues of Men...

1903
03:08:51,639 --> 03:08:53,876
...for this treachery.

1904
03:08:55,375 --> 03:08:58,093
Look! The trees! They're moving!

1905
03:09:02,918 --> 03:09:04,062
Where are they going?

1906
03:09:04,652 --> 03:09:07,751
They have business with the Orcs.

1907
03:09:08,389 --> 03:09:12,481
My business is with Isengard tonight...

1908

Mr. Frodo?

1926
03:10:59,271 --> 03:11:03,198
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.

1927
03:11:03,542 --> 03:11:05,931
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.

1928

Take them to my father.

Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.

1930

A weapon that will change our fortunes
in this war.

1931

Do you want to know
what happened to Boromir?

1932

You want to know
why your brother died?

1933
03:11:39,513 --> 03:11:43,091
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo
after swearing an oath to protect him!

1934
03:11:43,416 --> 03:11:45,238
He tried to kill him!

1935
03:11:45,485 --> 03:11:47,722
The Ring drove your brother mad!

1936
03:11:48,622 --> 03:11:50,377
Watch out!

1937
03:12:01,400 --> 03:12:02,482
Mr. Frodo?

1938
03:12:05,172 --> 03:12:06,928
They're here.

1939

They've come.

1941
03:12:39,140 --> 03:12:41,213
Stay here. Keep out of sight.

1942
03:12:43,111 --> 03:12:45,251
Take cover!

1943
03:13:02,665 --> 03:13:04,159
The fortress is taken.

1944
03:13:05,035 --> 03:13:06,179
It is over.

1945
03:13:06,402 --> 03:13:10,177
You said this fortress would never fall
while your men defend it.

1946
03:13:10,506 --> 03:13:13,321
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.

1947
03:13:16,179 --> 03:13:17,520
They're breaking in!

1948
03:13:20,216 --> 03:13:22,606
They're past the door!

1949
03:13:26,055 --> 03:13:30,016
Is there no other way for the women
and children to get out of the caves?

1950
03:13:32,797 --> 03:13:34,651
Is there no other way?

1951
03:13:36,334 --> 03:13:39,268
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.

1952
03:13:40,070 --> 03:13:42,176
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.

1953
03:13:47,144 --> 03:13:49,445
Tell the women and children
to make for the mountain pass.

1954

- And barricade the entrance!
- So much death.

A hit. A fine hit.

1995
03:18:33,506 --> 03:18:35,874
Break the dam!

1996

What are you doing?

2006
03:20:09,906 --> 03:20:11,400
Where are you going?

2007
03:21:09,634 --> 03:21:10,911
It's me.

2008
03:21:13,471 --> 03:21:15,576
It's your Sam.

2009
03:21:20,011 --> 03:21:22,565
Don't you know your Sam?

2010
03:21:40,332 --> 03:21:43,562
I can't do this, Sam.

2011
03:21:44,604 --> 03:21:46,514
I know.

2012
03:21:47,607 --> 03:21:49,875
It's all wrong.

2013
03:21:50,711 --> 03:21:52,652
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.

2014
03:22:00,186 --> 03:22:02,193
But we are.

2015
03:22:08,695 --> 03:22:11,598
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.

2016
03:22:11,898 --> 03:22:14,200
The ones that really mattered.

2017
03:22:15,336 --> 03:22:18,205
Full of darkness and danger they were.

2018
03:22:18,505 --> 03:22:21,353
And sometimes you didn't want
to know the end...

2019
03:22:21,675 --> 03:22:24,490
...because how could the end be happy?

2020
03:22:27,180 --> 03:22:29,254
How could the world go back
to the way it was...

2021
03:22:29,551 --> 03:22:32,811
...when so much bad had happened?

2022
03:22:33,822 --> 03:22:35,644
Victory!

2023
03:22:35,890 --> 03:22:37,383
We have victory!

2024
03:22:37,625 --> 03:22:41,399
But in the end,
it's only a passing thing...

2025
03:22:41,729 --> 03:22:43,007
...this shadow.

2026
03:22:43,231 --> 03:22:45,532
Even darkness must pass.

2027
03:22:45,800 --> 03:22:48,386
A new day will come.

2028
03:22:48,670 --> 03:22:52,467
And when the sun shines,
it will shine out the clearer.

2029
03:22:54,543 --> 03:22:56,813
Those were the stories
that stayed with you...

2030
03:22:57,079 --> 03:22:58,770
...that meant something.

2031
03:22:59,014 --> 03:23:01,470
Even if you were too small
to understand why.

2032
03:23:02,984 --> 03:23:06,694
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.

2033
03:23:07,023 --> 03:23:08,516
I know now.

2034
03:23:09,424 --> 03:23:11,530
Folk in those stories...

2035
03:23:11,794 --> 03:23:15,755
...had lots of chances of turning back,
only they didn't.

2036
03:23:16,099 --> 03:23:18,237
They kept going...

2037
03:23:19,001 --> 03:23:22,132
...because they were holding
on to something.

2038
03:23:23,872 --> 03:23:26,077
What are we holding on to, Sam?

2039
03:23:38,087 --> 03:23:41,862
That there's some good
in this world, Mr. Frodo.

2040
03:23:42,291 --> 03:23:44,812
And it's worth fighting for.

2041
03:24:11,854 --> 03:24:15,979
I think at last we understand one another,
Frodo Baggins.

2042
03:24:16,895 --> 03:24:20,669
You know the laws of our country,
the laws of your father.

2043
03:24:21,032 --> 03:24:23,137
If you let them go,
your life will be forfeit.

2044
03:24:27,605 --> 03:24:28,947
Then it is forfeit.

2045
03:24:31,743 --> 03:24:33,401
Release them.

2046
03:24:45,557 --> 03:24:47,532
Stay out of the forest!

2047
03:24:47,793 --> 03:24:49,516
Keep away from the trees!

2048
03:25:40,381 --> 03:25:42,104
Final count...

2049
03:25:42,349 --> 03:25:45,132
...42.
- Forty-two?

2050
03:25:46,720 --> 03:25:51,325
That's not bad for a pointy-eared
Elvish princeling.

2051
03:25:52,325 --> 03:25:55,839
I myself am sitting pretty on 43.

2052
03:26:00,102 --> 03:26:03,266
- Forty-three.
- He was already dead.

2053
03:26:04,171 --> 03:26:06,561
- He was twitching.
- He was twitching...

2054
03:26:06,842 --> 03:26:11,349
...because he's got my ax
embedded in his nervous system!

2055
03:26:13,749 --> 03:26:18,256
- He doesn't look too happy, does he?
- Not too happy at all, Merry.

2056
03:26:18,720 --> 03:26:22,104
Still, I suppose the view
would be quite nice from up there.

2057
03:26:22,458 --> 03:26:25,304
Oh, yes. It's a quality establishment.

2058
03:26:25,593 --> 03:26:28,311
I hear the staff are very good.

2059
03:26:34,103 --> 03:26:36,372
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

2060
03:26:36,639 --> 03:26:40,731
- The world's back to normal, that's all.
- No, it isn't.

2061
03:26:41,077 --> 03:26:42,254
I'm starving.

2062
03:26:42,478 --> 03:26:45,445
Good luck trying to find something
decent around here.

2063
03:26:45,748 --> 03:26:48,682
Probably dead rats and moldy bread.

2064
03:27:12,709 --> 03:27:15,012
Saruman's storeroom!

2065
03:27:16,280 --> 03:27:17,228
South Farthing

2066
03:27:17,447 --> 03:27:20,066
I don't believe it.

2067
03:27:20,351 --> 03:27:22,325
It can't be.

2068
03:27:23,021 --> 03:27:25,802
- It is!
- Longbottom Leaf.

2069
03:27:27,258 --> 03:27:29,462
The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing.

2070
03:27:29,927 --> 03:27:32,797
It's perfect. One barrel each.

2071
03:27:33,131 --> 03:27:34,211
Wait.

2072
03:27:34,999 --> 03:27:36,177
Do you think we should share it
with Treebeard?

2073
03:27:36,401 --> 03:27:37,830
Share it?

2074
03:27:39,771 --> 03:27:42,073
No. No.

2075
03:27:43,675 --> 03:27:44,951
Dead plant and all that.

2076
03:27:45,443 --> 03:27:47,516
Don't think he'd understand.

2077
03:27:48,880 --> 03:27:50,986
Could be a distant relative.

2078
03:27:51,850 --> 03:27:54,272
I get it.

2079
03:27:54,552 --> 03:27:57,236
Don't be hasty.

2080
03:27:58,490 --> 03:28:00,148
Exactly.

2081
03:28:01,327 --> 03:28:03,498
Bar-hrum.

2082
03:28:29,222 --> 03:28:30,466
This is the old sewer.

2083
03:28:30,691 --> 03:28:33,625
Runs right under the river
through to the edge of the city.

2084
03:28:33,927 --> 03:28:35,585
You'll find cover in the woods there.

2085
03:28:36,762 --> 03:28:39,131
Captain Faramir...

2086
03:28:39,866 --> 03:28:41,622
...you have shown your quality, sir.

2087
03:28:44,205 --> 03:28:45,448
The very highest.

2088
03:28:46,007 --> 03:28:48,527
The Shire must truly be a great realm,
Master Gamgee...

2089
03:28:48,809 --> 03:28:51,623
...where gardeners are held in high honor.

2090
03:28:52,947 --> 03:28:54,834
What road will you take
once you reach the woods?

2091
03:28:55,615 --> 03:28:57,108
Gollum says there's a path...

2092
03:28:57,350 --> 03:29:01,124
...near Minas Morgul
that climbs up into the mountains.

2093
03:29:01,756 --> 03:29:03,414
Cirith Ungol?

2094
03:29:07,028 --> 03:29:09,483
- Is that its name?
- No.

2095
03:29:09,764 --> 03:29:11,357
No!

2096
03:29:12,300 --> 03:29:15,148
- Yes.
- Frodo...

2097
03:29:15,670 --> 03:29:19,052
...they say a dark terror dwells
in the passes above Minas Morgul.

2098
03:29:20,107 --> 03:29:22,529
- You cannot go that way.
- It is the only way.

2099
03:29:22,977 --> 03:29:28,989
Master says we must go to Mordor,
so we must try.

2100
03:29:30,752 --> 03:29:32,475
I must.

2101
03:29:36,058 --> 03:29:39,472
Go, Frodo.
Go with the goodwill of all Men.

2102
03:29:39,794 --> 03:29:41,736
Thank you.

2103
03:29:53,675 --> 03:29:57,635
May death find you quickly
if you bring them to harm.

2104
03:30:10,260 --> 03:30:11,754
Come on, keep up.

2105
03:30:15,298 --> 03:30:17,948
Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers
to hurt you.

2106
03:30:18,736 --> 03:30:20,492
You know that, don't you?

2107
03:30:21,371 --> 03:30:22,834
He was trying to save you, see?

2108
03:30:23,440 --> 03:30:24,869
Save me?

2109
03:30:25,308 --> 03:30:27,380
So there's no hard feelings.

2110
03:30:27,645 --> 03:30:32,501
- Forgive and forget.
- No, no, no hard feelings.

2111
03:30:32,883 --> 03:30:35,403
Gollum, Gollum.

2112
03:30:36,553 --> 03:30:38,244
Yes, master.

2113
03:30:39,390 --> 03:30:42,107
- Nice Hobbits.
- Very decent of you.

2114
03:30:42,393 --> 03:30:44,596
Very decent, indeed, Gollum.

2115
03:30:50,235 --> 03:30:55,220
Sauron's wrath will be terrible,
his retribution swift.

2116
03:31:02,579 --> 03:31:05,449
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.

2117
03:31:06,251 --> 03:31:09,634
The battle for Middle-earth
is about to begin.

2118
03:31:14,925 --> 03:31:18,220
All our hopes now lie
with two little Hobbits...

2119
03:31:19,364 --> 03:31:22,462
...somewhere in the wilderness.

2120
03:31:25,905 --> 03:31:29,165
I wonder if we'll ever be
put into songs or tales.

2121
03:31:29,474 --> 03:31:30,783
What?

2122
03:31:31,009 --> 03:31:34,752
I wonder if people will ever say,
"Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."

2123
03:31:35,081 --> 03:31:38,211
And they'll say,
"Yes! That's one of my favorite stories."

2124
03:31:38,516 --> 03:31:41,332
"Frodo was really courageous,
wasn't he, Dad?"

2125
03:31:41,620 --> 03:31:43,212
"Yes, my boy.

2126
03:31:43,456 --> 03:31:47,100
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot."

2127
03:31:47,426 --> 03:31:49,848
Well, you've left out
one of the chief characters:

2128
03:31:50,129 --> 03:31:51,951
"Samwise the Brave."

2129
03:31:52,197 --> 03:31:54,816
I want to hear more about Sam.

2130
03:31:59,272 --> 03:32:02,118
Frodo wouldn't have got far
without Sam.

2131
03:32:03,609 --> 03:32:07,472
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.

2132
03:32:08,750 --> 03:32:10,058
So was I.

2133
03:32:18,992 --> 03:32:21,578
"Samwise the Brave."

2134
03:32:25,965 --> 03:32:27,243
Sméagol?

2135
03:32:27,502 --> 03:32:30,283
We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.

2136
03:32:30,570 --> 03:32:32,425
Master.

2137
03:32:32,672 --> 03:32:35,455
Master looks after us.

2138
03:32:36,344 --> 03:32:39,026
Master wouldn't hurt us.

2139
03:32:39,312 --> 03:32:41,680
Master broke his promise.

2140
03:32:41,950 --> 03:32:44,022
Don't ask Sméagol.

2141
03:32:44,285 --> 03:32:47,351
Poor, poor Sméagol.

2142
03:32:47,655 --> 03:32:50,372
Master betrayed us.

2143
03:32:50,658 --> 03:32:53,626
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

2144
03:32:53,928 --> 03:32:57,671
We ought to wring
his filthy little neck.

2145
03:32:58,000 --> 03:33:00,618
Kill him! Kill him!

2146
03:33:00,903 --> 03:33:02,332
Kill them both!

2147
03:33:02,603 --> 03:33:06,051
And then we take the precious...

2148
03:33:06,407 --> 03:33:09,757
...and we be the master!

2149
03:33:10,611 --> 03:33:13,164
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.

2150
03:33:13,449 --> 03:33:16,003
Eyes always watching.

2151
03:33:16,285 --> 03:33:19,700
Then we stabs them out.

2152
03:33:20,023 --> 03:33:24,333
Put out his eyeses
and make him crawl.

2153
03:33:24,694 --> 03:33:28,010
Yes. Yes. Yes.

2154
03:33:28,330 --> 03:33:30,915
Kill them both.

2155
03:33:31,200 --> 03:33:33,536
Yes. No! No!

2156
03:33:33,804 --> 03:33:37,381
It's too risky. It's too risky.

2157
03:33:38,241 --> 03:33:40,696
Where is he? Where has he gone?

2158
03:33:41,010 --> 03:33:43,498
- Hey, Gollum! Where are you?
- Sméagol?

2159
03:33:43,780 --> 03:33:48,962
We could let her do it.

2160
03:33:50,154 --> 03:33:54,115
Yes. She could do it.

2161
03:33:54,458 --> 03:33:58,833
Yes, precious, she could.

2162
03:33:59,195 --> 03:34:04,979
And then we takes it
once they're dead.

2163
03:34:06,170 --> 03:34:08,887
Once they're dead.

2164
03:34:13,444 --> 03:34:16,990
Come on, Hobbits. Long ways to go yet.

2165
03:34:17,314 --> 03:34:19,288
Sméagol will show you the way.

2166
03:34:19,550 --> 03:34:21,689
Follow me.
