00:01:19,096 --> 00:01:21,348
I've got one!

3
00:01:21,974 --> 00:01:23,976
I've got a fish, Sméag. Sméagol!

4
00:01:24,142 --> 00:01:27,271
Pull it in. Go on. Go on. Go on.
Pull it in.

5
00:01:35,487 --> 00:01:37,322
Déagol!

Déagol?

8
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:41,345
Déagol.

Give us that, Déagol, my love.

13
00:03:04,201 --> 00:03:05,494
Why?

14
00:03:06,578 --> 00:03:08,830
Because...

15
00:03:08,997 --> 00:03:12,751
...it's my birthday and I wants it.

00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,900

My precious.

20
00:04:59,608 --> 00:05:02,527
They cursed us.

21
00:05:02,694 --> 00:05:04,071
Murderer.

22
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:06,698
"Murderer" they called us.

23
00:05:06,865 --> 00:05:11,662
<i>They cursed us
and drove us away.</i>

24
00:05:12,788 --> 00:05:14,498
Gollum.

25
00:05:14,665 --> 00:05:16,375
Gollum.

26
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:18,502
Gollum.

27
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:25,000
And we wept, precious.

28
00:05:25,215 --> 00:05:31,500
<i><font color="#FF0000">...Daghburz-ishi makha gulshu darulu...</font></i>

00:05:25,217 --> 00:05:28,804
We wept to be so alone.

30
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:35,185
<i>and cool
So nice for feet</i>

31
00:05:36,186 --> 00:05:40,565

32
00:05:40,732 --> 00:05:43,986
<i>So juicy sweet</i>

33
00:05:49,741 --> 00:05:53,870
And we forgot the taste of bread...

34
00:05:54,037 --> 00:05:57,666
...the sound of trees...

35
00:05:58,542 --> 00:06:01,753
...the softness of the wind.

36
00:06:02,379 --> 00:06:08,051
We even forgot our own name.

37
00:06:16,184 --> 00:06:22,608
My precious.

38
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,112
Wake up!

39
00:07:10,155 --> 00:07:11,823
Wake up!

40
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:13,784
Wake up, sleepies.

41
00:07:13,951 --> 00:07:15,827
We must go, yes.

42
00:07:15,994 --> 00:07:18,664
We must go at once.

43
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:25,295
Haven't you had any sleep, Mr. Frodo?

44
00:07:27,506 --> 00:07:30,050
I've gone and had too much.

45
00:07:31,426 --> 00:07:33,178
Must be getting late.

46
00:07:33,345 --> 00:07:34,846
No.

47
00:07:35,013 --> 00:07:36,932
It isn't.

48
00:07:37,099 --> 00:07:40,143
It isn't midday yet.

49
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:42,896
The days are growing darker.

50
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,361
Come on!

51
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,032
Must go! No time!

52
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:56,576
Not before Mr. Frodo's
had something to eat.

53
00:07:56,743 --> 00:07:59,621
No time to lose, silly.

54
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,673
Here.

55
00:08:12,884 --> 00:08:14,720
What about you?

56
00:08:14,886 --> 00:08:18,265
Oh, no, I'm not hungry.
Leastways, not for lembas bread.

57
00:08:18,849 --> 00:08:20,225
Sam.

58
00:08:22,811 --> 00:08:24,354
All right.

59
00:08:24,521 --> 00:08:27,024
We don't have that much left.

60
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:30,068
We have to be careful
or we're going to run out.

61
00:08:32,237 --> 00:08:35,157
You go ahead and eat that, Mr. Frodo.

62
00:08:35,324 --> 00:08:36,742
I've rationed it.

63
00:08:37,242 --> 00:08:38,910
There should be enough.

64
00:08:41,079 --> 00:08:42,289
For what?

65
00:08:43,957 --> 00:08:45,709
The journey home.

66
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:55,886
Come, Hobbitses.

67
00:08:57,262 --> 00:08:59,139
Very close now.

68
00:08:59,306 --> 00:09:02,559
Very close to Mordor.

69
00:09:02,726 --> 00:09:05,395
No safe places here.

70
00:09:05,562 --> 00:09:07,731
Hurry.

71
00:10:00,117 --> 00:10:01,827
It's good.

72
00:10:02,744 --> 00:10:04,496
Definitely from the Shire.

73
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:08,834
Longbottom Leaf.

74
00:10:14,172 --> 00:10:18,510
I feel like I'm back at
The Green Dragon.

75
00:10:19,594 --> 00:10:22,848
-Green Dragon.
-A mug of ale in my hand.

76
00:10:23,015 --> 00:10:27,603
Putting my feet up on a settle
after a hard day's work.

77
00:10:28,186 --> 00:10:31,648
Only, you've never done
a hard day's work.

78
00:10:44,453 --> 00:10:47,497
Welcome, my lords...

79
00:10:47,664 --> 00:10:49,916
...to Isengard!

80
00:10:50,292 --> 00:10:54,046
You young rascals!
A merry hunt you've led us on...

81
00:10:54,212 --> 00:10:59,217
...and now we find you feasting
and... and smoking!

82
00:10:59,384 --> 00:11:02,554
We are sitting on a field of victory...

83
00:11:02,721 --> 00:11:06,224
...enjoying a few well-earned comforts.

84
00:11:07,309 --> 00:11:11,146
The salted pork is particularly good.

85
00:11:11,688 --> 00:11:14,066
Salted pork?

86
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:18,695
-Hobbits.
-We're under orders from Treebeard...

87
00:11:18,862 --> 00:11:21,698
...who's taken over management
of Isengard.

88
00:11:24,242 --> 00:11:27,245
Young Master Gandalf.

89
00:11:27,412 --> 00:11:32,000
I'm glad you've come.

90
00:11:32,167 --> 00:11:36,588
Wood and water, stock and stone
I can master.

91
00:11:36,755 --> 00:11:40,425
But there is a wizard to manage here...

92
00:11:40,592 --> 00:11:42,594
...locked in his tower.

93
00:11:45,264 --> 00:11:46,598
Show yourself.

94
00:11:46,848 --> 00:11:48,558
Be careful.

95
00:11:49,351 --> 00:11:52,020
Even in defeat, Saruman is dangerous.

96
00:11:52,187 --> 00:11:54,314
Well, let's just have his head
and be done with it.

97
00:11:54,481 --> 00:11:56,525
No.

98
00:11:56,858 --> 00:11:59,194
We need him alive.

99
00:12:00,195 --> 00:12:02,781
We need him to talk.

100
00:12:04,658 --> 00:12:08,870
You have fought many wars
and slain many men, Théoden King...

101
00:12:09,037 --> 00:12:10,539
...and made peace afterwards.

102
00:12:10,706 --> 00:12:15,669
Can we not take counsel together
as we once did, my old friend?

103
00:12:15,836 --> 00:12:19,047
Can we not have peace, you and I?

104
00:12:19,214 --> 00:12:21,133
We shall have peace.

105
00:12:23,051 --> 00:12:25,178
We shall have peace...

106
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:29,391
...when you answer
for the burning of the Westfold...

107
00:12:29,558 --> 00:12:32,311
...and the children that lie dead there!

108
00:12:33,061 --> 00:12:37,232
We shall have peace
when the lives of the soldiers...

109
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:39,484
...whose bodies were hewn
even as they lay dead...

110
00:12:39,651 --> 00:12:43,196
...against the gates of the Hornburg,
are avenged!

111
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:50,329
When you hang from a gibbet
for the sport of your own crows...

112
00:12:51,246 --> 00:12:53,498
...we shall have peace.

113
00:12:56,251 --> 00:12:58,962
Gibbets and crows?

114
00:12:59,296 --> 00:13:00,547
Dotard!

115
00:13:02,007 --> 00:13:04,843
What do you want, Gandalf Greyhame?

116
00:13:05,844 --> 00:13:08,347
Let me guess. The Key of Orthanc.

117
00:13:08,513 --> 00:13:11,433
Or perhaps the Keys of Barad-dûr itself...

118
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,604
...along with the crowns of the seven kings
and the rods of the Five Wizards!

119
00:13:15,771 --> 00:13:18,732
Your treachery has already cost
many lives.

120
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:21,276
Thousands more are now at risk.

121
00:13:21,443 --> 00:13:23,820
But you could save them, Saruman.

122
00:13:23,987 --> 00:13:26,281
You were deep in the enemy's counsel.

123
00:13:26,448 --> 00:13:29,743
So you have come here for information.

124
00:13:30,619 --> 00:13:32,454
I have some for you.

125
00:13:37,918 --> 00:13:40,879
Something festers
in the heart of Middle-earth.

126
00:13:41,046 --> 00:13:43,298
Something that you have failed to see.

127
00:13:45,801 --> 00:13:49,304
But the Great Eye has seen it.

128
00:13:50,347 --> 00:13:54,059
Even now he presses his advantage.

129
00:13:55,811 --> 00:13:59,147
His attack will come soon.

130
00:14:01,358 --> 00:14:03,485
You're all going to die.

131
00:14:05,988 --> 00:14:09,241
But you know this, don't you, Gandalf?

132
00:14:09,408 --> 00:14:14,037
You cannot think that this Ranger
will ever sit upon the throne of Gondor.

133
00:14:14,204 --> 00:14:20,294
This exile, crept from the shadows,
will never be crowned king.

134
00:14:21,628 --> 00:14:25,299
Gandalf does not hesitate
to sacrifice those closest to him...

135
00:14:26,216 --> 00:14:28,427
...those he professes to love.

136
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:34,016
Tell me, what words of comfort
did you give the Halfling...

137
00:14:34,182 --> 00:14:37,227
...before you sent him to his doom?

138
00:14:39,646 --> 00:14:44,359
The path that you have set him on
can only lead to death.

139
00:14:44,693 --> 00:14:46,862
I've heard enough!

140
00:14:47,029 --> 00:14:48,864
Shoot him.
Stick an arrow in his gob.

141
00:14:49,364 --> 00:14:51,033
No.

142
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:53,702
Come down, Saruman...

143
00:14:53,869 --> 00:14:57,831
-..and your life will be spared.
-Save your pity and your mercy.

144
00:14:57,998 --> 00:14:59,333
I have no use for it!

145
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:10,010
Saruman...

146
00:15:11,053 --> 00:15:14,222
...your staff is broken.

147
00:15:25,108 --> 00:15:28,570
Gríma, you need not follow him.

148
00:15:29,738 --> 00:15:32,407
You were not always as you are now.

149
00:15:32,574 --> 00:15:35,410
You were once a Man of Rohan.

150
00:15:35,577 --> 00:15:36,828
Come down.

151
00:15:36,995 --> 00:15:39,706
A Man of Rohan?

152
00:15:40,624 --> 00:15:42,876
What is the house of Rohan...

153
00:15:43,043 --> 00:15:46,713
...but a thatched barn
where brigands drink in the reek...

154
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,592
...and their brats roll on the floor
with the dogs?

155
00:15:51,093 --> 00:15:57,557
The victory at Helm's Deep does not
belong to you, Théoden Horse-master.

156
00:15:58,183 --> 00:16:02,771
You are a lesser son of greater sires.

157
00:16:05,107 --> 00:16:06,817
Gríma...

158
00:16:07,651 --> 00:16:09,528
...come down.

159
00:16:09,861 --> 00:16:11,280
Be free of him.

160
00:16:11,446 --> 00:16:15,450
-Free? He will never be free.
-No.

161
00:16:15,826 --> 00:16:18,453
Get down, cur!

162
00:16:20,205 --> 00:16:21,498
Saruman!

163
00:16:21,665 --> 00:16:24,293
You were deep in the enemy's counsel.

164
00:16:24,793 --> 00:16:26,962
Tell us what you know!

165
00:16:28,463 --> 00:16:33,719
You withdraw your guard, and I will tell you
where your doom will be decided.

166
00:16:33,885 --> 00:16:37,431
I will not be held prisoner here.

167
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:06,084
Send word to all our allies...

168
00:17:06,251 --> 00:17:09,171
...and to every corner of Middle-earth
that still stands free.

169
00:17:09,713 --> 00:17:12,841
The enemy moves against us.
We need to know where he will strike.

170
00:17:32,027 --> 00:17:35,989
The filth of Saruman...

171
00:17:36,156 --> 00:17:39,993
...is washing away.

172
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,706
Trees will come back to live here.

173
00:17:45,207 --> 00:17:47,376
Young trees.

174
00:17:47,542 --> 00:17:49,753
-Wild trees.
-Pippin!

175
00:17:59,221 --> 00:18:01,390
Bless my bark!

176
00:18:01,556 --> 00:18:03,433
Peregrin Took!

177
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,228
I'll take that, my lad.

178
00:18:06,395 --> 00:18:08,272
Quickly, now.

179
00:18:58,447 --> 00:19:04,036
Tonight we remember those who
gave their blood to defend this country.

180
00:19:04,703 --> 00:19:06,747
Hail the victorious dead.

181
00:19:06,913 --> 00:19:08,332
Hail!

182
00:19:19,301 --> 00:19:21,219
No pauses.

183
00:19:21,386 --> 00:19:25,557
-No spills.
-And no regurgitation.

184
00:19:26,058 --> 00:19:27,726
So it's a drinking game?

185
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:31,980
Last one standing wins.

186
00:19:36,318 --> 00:19:38,320
What'll we drink to?
Let's drink to victory!

187
00:19:38,487 --> 00:19:39,905
To victory!

188
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:55,900
<font color="#800080">Westu Aragorn hál.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">(Be-thou Aragorn well.)</font>

189
00:20:23,865 --> 00:20:25,534
I am happy for you.

190
00:20:25,909 --> 00:20:28,328
He is an honourable man.

191
00:20:28,745 --> 00:20:31,206
You are both honourable men.

192
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:38,380
It was not Théoden of Rohan
who led our people to victory.

193
00:20:46,555 --> 00:20:48,390
Don't listen to me.

194
00:20:49,224 --> 00:20:50,726
You are young.

195
00:20:50,892 --> 00:20:53,228
And tonight is for you.

196
00:21:07,576 --> 00:21:09,244
Here, here.

197
00:21:10,746 --> 00:21:16,668
It's the Dwarves that go swimming
with little, hairy women.

198
00:21:22,049 --> 00:21:23,300
I feel something.

199
00:21:25,427 --> 00:21:27,930
A slight tingle in my fingers.

200
00:21:28,639 --> 00:21:30,223
I think it's affecting me.

201
00:21:32,142 --> 00:21:33,852
What did I say?

202
00:21:34,019 --> 00:21:37,356
He can't hold his liquor.

203
00:21:44,696 --> 00:21:46,031
Game over.

204
00:21:46,198 --> 00:21:49,618
<i>Oh, you can search far and wide
You can drink the whole town dry</i>

205
00:21:49,785 --> 00:21:53,747
<i>But you'll never find a beer so brown
But you'll never find a beer so brown</i>

206
00:21:53,914 --> 00:21:58,293
<i>As the one we drink in our hometown
As the one we drink in our hometown</i>

207
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:02,381
<i>You can drink your fancy ales
You can drink 'em by the flagon</i>

208
00:22:02,547 --> 00:22:05,717
<i>But the only brew for the brave and true</i>

209
00:22:08,345 --> 00:22:09,638
Pippin!

210
00:22:10,097 --> 00:22:13,141
<i>But the only brew for the brave and true</i>

211
00:22:13,475 --> 00:22:16,186
<i>Comes from The Green Dragon</i>

212
00:22:18,897 --> 00:22:21,733
Thank you! I win!

213
00:22:23,485 --> 00:22:25,988
No news of Frodo?

214
00:22:26,154 --> 00:22:29,658
No word. Nothing.

215
00:22:30,492 --> 00:22:32,661
We have time.

216
00:22:34,162 --> 00:22:37,457
Every day, Frodo moves closer to Mordor.

217
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:40,294
Do we know that?

218
00:22:44,131 --> 00:22:45,841
What does your heart tell you?

219
00:22:52,889 --> 00:22:56,226
That Frodo is alive.

220
00:22:58,395 --> 00:23:00,188
Yes.

221
00:23:02,874 --> 00:23:05,043
Yes, he's alive.

222
00:23:07,295 --> 00:23:10,132
Too risky. Too risky.

223
00:23:10,298 --> 00:23:11,550
Thieves.

224
00:23:11,717 --> 00:23:13,760
They stole it from us.

225
00:23:13,927 --> 00:23:17,431
Kill them. Kill them. Kill them both.

226
00:23:19,474 --> 00:23:22,310
Quiet! Mustn't wake them.

227
00:23:22,477 --> 00:23:25,021
Mustn't ruin it now.

228
00:23:25,188 --> 00:23:27,274
But they knows.

229
00:23:27,441 --> 00:23:29,317
They knows.

230
00:23:29,484 --> 00:23:32,112
They suspects us.

231
00:23:33,321 --> 00:23:36,867
What's it saying, my precious, my love?

232
00:23:37,034 --> 00:23:40,620
Is Sméagol losing his nerve?

233
00:23:41,288 --> 00:23:43,665
No. Not.

234
00:23:43,832 --> 00:23:48,086
Never. Sméagol hates nasty Hobbitses.

235
00:23:48,253 --> 00:23:53,091
Sméagol wants to see them dead.

236
00:23:53,258 --> 00:23:55,802
And we will.

237
00:23:55,969 --> 00:24:00,015
Sméagol did it once.
He can do it again.

238
00:24:03,251 --> 00:24:05,921
It's ours!

239
00:24:06,088 --> 00:24:08,757
Ours!

240
00:24:09,883 --> 00:24:12,761
We must get the precious.
We must get it back.

241
00:24:12,928 --> 00:24:16,348
Patience! Patience, my love.

242
00:24:16,515 --> 00:24:20,894
First we must lead them to her.

243
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:26,775
We lead them to the Winding Stair.

244
00:24:26,942 --> 00:24:29,611
Yes, the stairs. And then?

245
00:24:29,778 --> 00:24:32,781
Up, up, up, up,
up the stairs we go...

246
00:24:32,948 --> 00:24:39,371
...until we come to the tunnel.

247
00:24:39,746 --> 00:24:42,874
And when they go in...

248
00:24:43,041 --> 00:24:45,836
...there's no coming out.

249
00:24:46,753 --> 00:24:49,631
She's always hungry.

250
00:24:50,382 --> 00:24:54,595
She always needs to feed.

251
00:24:54,761 --> 00:24:56,179
She must eat.

252
00:24:56,346 --> 00:24:58,473
All she gets is filthy Orcses.

253
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,393
And they doesn't taste very nice,
does they, precious?

254
00:25:02,019 --> 00:25:03,645
No.

255
00:25:03,812 --> 00:25:08,525
Not very nice at all, my love.

256
00:25:08,692 --> 00:25:11,486
She hungers for sweeter meats.

257
00:25:11,653 --> 00:25:13,488
Hobbit meat.

258
00:25:13,655 --> 00:25:18,493
And when she throws away the bones
and the empty clothes...

259
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:21,747
...then we will find it.

260
00:25:21,913 --> 00:25:26,251
And take it for me!

261
00:25:28,003 --> 00:25:29,421
For us.

262
00:25:29,921 --> 00:25:32,925
Yes. We meant "for us."

263
00:25:33,091 --> 00:25:36,553
Gollum. Gollum.

264
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:41,224
The precious will be ours...

265
00:25:41,391 --> 00:25:45,896
...once the Hobbitses are dead!

266
00:25:46,396 --> 00:25:47,856
You treacherous little toad!

267
00:25:50,567 --> 00:25:52,861
No! No! Master!

268
00:25:53,028 --> 00:25:54,655
No, Sam! Leave him alone!

269
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:58,200
I heard it from his own mouth.
He means to murder us.

270
00:25:58,367 --> 00:26:02,537
Never! Sméagol wouldn't hurt a fly.

271
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:06,625
He's a horrid, fat Hobbit...

272
00:26:06,792 --> 00:26:08,377
...who hates Sméagol...

273
00:26:08,543 --> 00:26:11,338
...and who makes up nasty lies.

274
00:26:11,505 --> 00:26:14,174
You miserable little maggot!
I'll stove your head in!

275
00:26:14,549 --> 00:26:15,842
Sam!

276
00:26:16,218 --> 00:26:18,512
Call me a liar? You're a liar!

277
00:26:19,471 --> 00:26:23,392
-You scare him off, we're lost!
-I don't care! I can't do it, Mr. Frodo.

278
00:26:23,558 --> 00:26:26,728
-I won't wait around for him to kill us!
-I'm not sending him away.

279
00:26:27,062 --> 00:26:28,397
You don't see it, do you?

280
00:26:28,814 --> 00:26:30,232
He's a villain.

281
00:26:31,233 --> 00:26:34,861
We can't do this by ourselves, Sam.
Not without a guide.

282
00:26:35,696 --> 00:26:38,573
I need you on my side.

283
00:26:39,366 --> 00:26:41,702
I'm on your side, Mr. Frodo.

284
00:26:43,203 --> 00:26:46,164
I know, Sam. I know.

285
00:26:46,707 --> 00:26:48,709
Trust me.

286
00:26:48,875 --> 00:26:51,253
Come, Sméagol.

287
00:27:59,196 --> 00:28:00,656
What time is it?

288
00:28:02,991 --> 00:28:04,493
Not yet dawn.

289
00:28:11,416 --> 00:28:14,461
I dreamed I saw a great wave...

290
00:28:14,628 --> 00:28:18,632
...climbing over green lands
and above the hills.

291
00:28:19,883 --> 00:28:22,344
I stood upon the brink.

292
00:28:23,262 --> 00:28:26,431
It was utterly dark in the abyss
before my feet.

293
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:31,144
A light shone behind me...

294
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:34,189
...but I could not turn.

295
00:28:34,356 --> 00:28:37,776
I could only stand there, waiting.

296
00:28:39,236 --> 00:28:41,947
Night changes many thoughts.

297
00:28:42,322 --> 00:28:44,491
Sleep, Éowyn.

298
00:28:45,033 --> 00:28:47,286
Sleep...

299
00:28:49,997 --> 00:28:51,873
...while you can.

300
00:29:16,023 --> 00:29:18,317
The stars are veiled.

301
00:29:19,318 --> 00:29:22,821
Something stirs in the east.

302
00:29:23,488 --> 00:29:26,617
A sleepless malice.

303
00:29:28,619 --> 00:29:31,413
The Eye of the enemy is moving.

304
00:29:44,843 --> 00:29:47,554
What are you doing?

305
00:29:52,184 --> 00:29:53,644
Pippin!

306
00:30:01,151 --> 00:30:02,903
Pippin?

307
00:30:15,791 --> 00:30:17,125
Pippin.

308
00:30:17,793 --> 00:30:20,462
-What, are you mad?
-I just want to look at it.

309
00:30:20,629 --> 00:30:21,755
Just one more time.

310
00:30:22,005 --> 00:30:24,091
Put it back.

311
00:30:34,351 --> 00:30:36,144
Pippin.

312
00:30:42,651 --> 00:30:44,152
No!

313
00:30:49,241 --> 00:30:50,492
Pippin.

314
00:30:53,829 --> 00:30:55,038
He is here.

315
00:30:55,205 --> 00:30:57,499
I see you.

316
00:31:00,502 --> 00:31:02,129
Pippin!

317
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,500
<font color="#FF0000">Ash nazg thrakatum</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">(Bring the One Ring)</font>

318
00:31:16,768 --> 00:31:19,521
Help! Gandalf, help!

319
00:31:21,273 --> 00:31:23,150
Someone help him!

320
00:31:29,531 --> 00:31:30,741
Pippin!

321
00:31:31,867 --> 00:31:33,118
Fool of a Took!

322
00:31:54,222 --> 00:31:56,433
Look at me.

323
00:31:58,393 --> 00:32:02,522
Gandalf, forgive me.

324
00:32:02,689 --> 00:32:04,566
Look at me.

325
00:32:04,733 --> 00:32:06,568
What did you see?

326
00:32:10,072 --> 00:32:12,157
A tree.

327
00:32:13,116 --> 00:32:14,993
There was a white tree...

328
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,662
...in a courtyard of stone.

329
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,749
It was dead.

330
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,755
The city was burning.

331
00:32:26,922 --> 00:32:30,300
Minas Tirith? Is that what you saw?

332
00:32:30,968 --> 00:32:33,011
I saw...

333
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:37,766
I saw him.

334
00:32:40,769 --> 00:32:43,021
I could hear his voice in my head.

335
00:32:43,188 --> 00:32:45,607
And what did you tell him?

336
00:32:45,774 --> 00:32:47,609
Speak!

337
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:54,950
He asked me my name.
I didn't answer.

338
00:32:55,117 --> 00:32:56,576
He hurt me.

339
00:32:56,743 --> 00:32:59,204
What did you tell him
about Frodo and the Ring?

340
00:33:02,708 --> 00:33:05,168
There was no lie in Pippin's eyes.

341
00:33:06,003 --> 00:33:08,255
A fool...

342
00:33:08,422 --> 00:33:10,716
...but an honest fool he remains.

343
00:33:11,174 --> 00:33:14,720
He told Sauron nothing
of Frodo and the Ring.

344
00:33:15,762 --> 00:33:18,140
We've been strangely fortunate.

345
00:33:18,307 --> 00:33:22,185
Pippin saw in the palantír
a glimpse of the enemy's plan.

346
00:33:23,103 --> 00:33:27,065
Sauron moves to strike
the city of Minas Tirith.

347
00:33:27,649 --> 00:33:31,403
His defeat at Helm's Deep
showed our enemy one thing.

348
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:33,905
He knows the heir of Elendil
has come forth.

349
00:33:34,072 --> 00:33:36,199
Men are not as weak as he supposed.

350
00:33:36,366 --> 00:33:40,162
There is courage still, strength
enough perhaps to challenge him.

351
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:42,247
Sauron fears this.

352
00:33:42,414 --> 00:33:46,752
He will not risk the peoples of
Middle-earth uniting under one banner.

353
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,339
He will raze Minas Tirith
to the ground...

354
00:33:50,505 --> 00:33:54,009
...before he sees a king
return to the throne of Men.

355
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:58,096
If the beacons of Gondor are lit,
Rohan must be ready for war.

356
00:33:59,014 --> 00:34:01,224
Tell me...

357
00:34:01,391 --> 00:34:05,187
...why should we ride to the aid
of those who did not come to ours?

358
00:34:09,066 --> 00:34:10,901
What do we owe Gondor?

359
00:34:12,027 --> 00:34:14,071
-I will go.
-No!

360
00:34:14,237 --> 00:34:17,407
-They must be warned.
-They will be.

361
00:34:20,827 --> 00:34:23,372
You must come to Minas Tirith
by another road.

362
00:34:23,914 --> 00:34:28,377
Follow the river.
Look to the black ships.

363
00:34:29,336 --> 00:34:31,296
Understand this:

364
00:34:31,463 --> 00:34:35,133
Things are now in motion
that cannot be undone.

365
00:34:36,635 --> 00:34:38,720
I ride for Minas Tirith...

366
00:34:40,973 --> 00:34:43,642
...and I won't be going alone.

367
00:34:45,394 --> 00:34:49,064
Of all the inquisitive Hobbits,
Peregrin Took, you are the worst.

368
00:34:50,065 --> 00:34:51,733
Hurry! Hurry!

369
00:34:53,235 --> 00:34:54,653
Where are we going?

370
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,071
Why did you look?

371
00:34:56,238 --> 00:34:58,991
Why do you always have to look?

372
00:34:59,157 --> 00:35:02,244
-I don't know. I can't help it.
-You never can.

373
00:35:02,703 --> 00:35:04,121
I'm sorry, all right?

374
00:35:06,206 --> 00:35:09,126
-I won't do it again.
-Don't you understand?

375
00:35:09,876 --> 00:35:11,837
The enemy thinks you have the Ring.

376
00:35:12,004 --> 00:35:15,757
He's going to be looking for you, Pip.
They have to get you out of here.

377
00:35:17,175 --> 00:35:19,845
And you...? You're coming with me?

378
00:35:22,055 --> 00:35:23,473
Merry?

379
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,933
Come on.

380
00:35:30,439 --> 00:35:31,815
How far is Minas Tirith?

381
00:35:31,982 --> 00:35:34,610
Three days' ride, as the Nazgûl flies.

382
00:35:34,776 --> 00:35:38,280
And you better hope we don't have
one of those on our tail.

383
00:35:38,989 --> 00:35:40,490
Here.

384
00:35:40,657 --> 00:35:42,451
Something for the road.

385
00:35:43,327 --> 00:35:45,287
The last of the Longbottom Leaf.

386
00:35:45,454 --> 00:35:49,458
I know you've run out.
You smoke too much, Pippin.

387
00:35:49,625 --> 00:35:52,127
But... But we'll see each other soon.

388
00:35:55,464 --> 00:35:57,966
-Won't we?
-I don't know.

389
00:35:59,968 --> 00:36:02,012
I don't know what's going to happen.

390
00:36:02,179 --> 00:36:03,889
-Merry.
-Run, Shadowfax.

391
00:36:04,056 --> 00:36:05,515
Show us the meaning of haste.

392
00:36:05,682 --> 00:36:07,601
Merry!

393
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:19,196
Merry!

394
00:36:29,665 --> 00:36:31,166
He's always followed me...

395
00:36:31,833 --> 00:36:33,877
...everywhere I went...

396
00:36:34,211 --> 00:36:36,004
...since before we were tweens.

397
00:36:37,172 --> 00:36:41,093
I would get him into
the worst sort of trouble...

398
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:43,345
...but I was always there to get him out.

399
00:36:45,806 --> 00:36:47,683
Now he's gone.

400
00:36:49,351 --> 00:36:52,271
Just like Frodo and Sam.

401
00:36:52,896 --> 00:36:55,649
One thing I have learned about Hobbits:

402
00:36:55,816 --> 00:36:57,484
They're a most hardy folk.

403
00:36:58,026 --> 00:37:01,738
Foolhardy, maybe. He's a Took.

404
00:37:16,211 --> 00:37:18,505
Take her by the safest road.

405
00:37:18,672 --> 00:37:21,174
A ship lies anchored
In the Grey Havens.

406
00:37:21,341 --> 00:37:25,220
It waits to carry her across the sea.

407
00:37:25,387 --> 00:37:28,765
The last journey of Arwen Undómiel.

...only death.

417
00:38:47,469 --> 00:38:48,762
Lady Arwen...

418
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,598
...we cannot delay.

419
00:38:54,059 --> 00:38:55,310
My lady!

420
00:39:14,705 --> 00:39:17,332
-Tell me what you have seen.
-Arwen.

421
00:39:17,499 --> 00:39:19,459
You have the gift of foresight.

422
00:39:19,626 --> 00:39:21,420
What did you see?

423
00:39:22,045 --> 00:39:25,382
I looked into your future,
and I saw death.

424
00:39:25,924 --> 00:39:28,051
But there is also life.

425
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:34,016
You saw there was a child.
You saw my son.

426
00:39:34,641 --> 00:39:37,185
That future is almost gone.

427
00:39:37,352 --> 00:39:39,354
But it is not lost.

428
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:44,151
Nothing is certain.

429
00:39:45,861 --> 00:39:48,572
Some things are certain.

430
00:39:52,367 --> 00:39:55,203
If I leave him now...

431
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:57,998
...I will regret it forever.

432
00:39:59,082 --> 00:40:01,418
It is time.

433
00:40:06,673 --> 00:40:10,469
From the ashes a fire shall be woken

434
00:40:10,636 --> 00:40:14,056
A light from the shadow shall spring

435
00:40:14,222 --> 00:40:17,517
Renewed shall be blade that was broken

436
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:28,111
The crownless again shall be king

437
00:40:31,865 --> 00:40:33,909
Re-forge the sword.

The life of the Eldar is leaving you.

444
00:41:21,415 --> 00:41:23,333

...there is no ship now
that can bear me hence.

448
00:42:20,307 --> 00:42:23,143
We've just passed
into the realm of Gondor.

449
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:37,032
Minas Tirith.

450
00:42:37,616 --> 00:42:39,952
City of kings.

451
00:43:11,316 --> 00:43:13,110
Make way!

452
00:43:42,306 --> 00:43:44,141
It's the tree.

453
00:43:44,308 --> 00:43:45,976
Gandalf. Gandalf.

454
00:43:46,143 --> 00:43:48,395
Yes, the White Tree of Gondor.

455
00:43:48,562 --> 00:43:50,397
The tree of the king.

456
00:43:50,564 --> 00:43:53,233
Lord Denethor, however,
is not king.

457
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,069
He is a steward only,
a caretaker of the throne.

458
00:43:56,820 --> 00:44:00,365
Now listen carefully.
Lord Denethor is Boromir's father.

459
00:44:00,907 --> 00:44:04,703
To give him news of his beloved son's
death would be most unwise.

460
00:44:05,162 --> 00:44:08,624
And do not mention Frodo or the Ring.

461
00:44:09,499 --> 00:44:12,252
And say nothing of Aragorn either.

462
00:44:14,087 --> 00:44:17,966
In fact, it's better if you
don't speak at all, Peregrin Took.

463
00:44:48,121 --> 00:44:54,628
Hail Denethor, son of Ecthelion,
lord and steward of Gondor.

464
00:45:00,133 --> 00:45:04,846
I come with tidings in this dark hour,
and with counsel.

465
00:45:05,806 --> 00:45:09,184
Perhaps you come to explain this.

466
00:45:14,815 --> 00:45:19,361
Perhaps you come to tell me
why my son is dead.

467

<i><font color="#0080C0">♫ Ehtelë lína, manna lelyal[ye]?</font></i>
<i><font color="#FFFF00">(The fountain is still, where did you go?)</font></i>

468
00:45:33,834 --> 00:45:36,837
Boromir died to save us...

469
00:45:37,004 --> 00:45:38,672
...my kinsman and me.

470
00:45:38,839 --> 00:45:42,342
-He fell defending us from many foes.
-Pippin.

471
00:45:47,848 --> 00:45:51,310
I offer you my service, such as it is...

472
00:45:51,852 --> 00:45:53,854
...in payment of this debt.

473
00:45:56,023 --> 00:45:59,359
This is my first command to you.

474
00:46:00,068 --> 00:46:03,530
How did you escape
and my son did not...

475
00:46:03,864 --> 00:46:06,199
...so mighty a man as he was?

476
00:46:06,867 --> 00:46:10,203
The mightiest man
may be slain by one arrow...

477
00:46:10,454 --> 00:46:12,372
...and Boromir was pierced by many.

478
00:46:16,501 --> 00:46:18,211
Get up.

479
00:46:18,378 --> 00:46:23,008
My lord, there will be a time
to grieve for Boromir...

480
00:46:23,467 --> 00:46:25,218
...but it is not now.

481
00:46:25,928 --> 00:46:28,138
War is coming.

482
00:46:28,472 --> 00:46:32,893
The enemy is on your doorstep.
As steward, you are charged...

483
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:37,230
...with the defense of this city.
Where are Gondor's armies?

484
00:46:37,397 --> 00:46:42,277
You still have friends.
You are not alone in this fight.

485
00:46:42,444 --> 00:46:46,949
Send word to Théoden of Rohan.
Light the beacons.

486
00:46:48,533 --> 00:46:52,079
You think you are wise, Mithrandir.

487
00:46:52,245 --> 00:46:55,290
Yet for all your subtleties,
you have not wisdom.

488
00:46:57,417 --> 00:47:01,588
Do you think the eyes
of the White Tower are blind?

489
00:47:01,755 --> 00:47:04,841
I have seen more than you know.

490
00:47:05,008 --> 00:47:08,220
With your left hand you would use me
as a shield against Mordor.

491
00:47:08,387 --> 00:47:11,265
And with your right
you'd seek to supplant me.

492
00:47:11,431 --> 00:47:15,143
I know who rides with Théoden of Rohan.

493
00:47:15,310 --> 00:47:21,275
Oh, yes. Word has reached my ears
of this Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

494
00:47:21,441 --> 00:47:26,280
And I tell you now, I will not bow
to this Ranger from the North...

495
00:47:26,446 --> 00:47:30,951
...last of a ragged house
long bereft of lordship.

496
00:47:31,118 --> 00:47:36,957
Authority is not given to you
to deny the return of the king, steward.

497
00:47:37,124 --> 00:47:41,545
The rule of Gondor is mine
and no other's.

498
00:47:46,717 --> 00:47:48,510
Come.

499
00:47:56,435 --> 00:47:59,021
All has turned to vain ambition.

500
00:47:59,187 --> 00:48:02,649
He would even use his grief
as a cloak.

501
00:48:05,527 --> 00:48:08,322
A thousand years
this city has stood.

502
00:48:09,406 --> 00:48:11,825
Now, at the whim of a madman,
it will fall.

503
00:48:13,035 --> 00:48:15,245
And the White Tree,
the tree of the king...

504
00:48:15,412 --> 00:48:16,955
...will never bloom again.

505
00:48:17,122 --> 00:48:20,500
-Why are they still guarding it?
-They guard it because they have hope.

506
00:48:20,667 --> 00:48:23,837
A faint and fading hope
that one day it will flower.

507
00:48:24,004 --> 00:48:28,759
That a king will come
and this city will be as it once was...

508
00:48:28,926 --> 00:48:31,845
...before it fell into decay.

509
00:48:32,012 --> 00:48:35,265
The old wisdom borne out
of the West was forsaken.

510
00:48:35,432 --> 00:48:39,728
Kings made tombs more splendid
than the houses of the living...

511
00:48:39,937 --> 00:48:41,855
...and counted the old names
of their descent...

512
00:48:42,022 --> 00:48:44,816
...dearer than the names of their sons.

513
00:48:44,983 --> 00:48:50,030
Childless lords sat in aged halls,
musing on heraldry...

514
00:48:50,197 --> 00:48:55,535
...or in high, cold towers,
asking questions of the stars.

515
00:48:55,702 --> 00:48:59,498
And so the people of Gondor
fell into ruin.

516
00:49:00,457 --> 00:49:02,793
The line of kings failed.

517
00:49:03,502 --> 00:49:05,879
The White Tree withered.

518
00:49:06,588 --> 00:49:10,759
The rule of Gondor was given over
to lesser men.

519
00:49:21,478 --> 00:49:22,729
Mordor.

520
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:26,900
Yes, there it lies.

521
00:49:27,734 --> 00:49:31,071
This city has dwelt ever
in the sight of its shadow.

522
00:49:33,073 --> 00:49:34,741
A storm is coming.

523
00:49:35,409 --> 00:49:38,328
This is not the weather of the world.

524
00:49:38,495 --> 00:49:40,706
This is a device of Sauron's making.

525
00:49:40,872 --> 00:49:44,626
A broil of fume
he sends ahead of his host.

526
00:49:45,210 --> 00:49:47,671
The Orcs of Mordor
have no love of daylight...

527
00:49:47,838 --> 00:49:49,673
...so he covers the face of the sun...

528
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:53,594
...to ease their passage
along the road to war.

529
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:57,055
When the Shadow of Mordor
reaches this city...

530
00:49:57,764 --> 00:49:59,474
...it will begin.

531
00:50:01,143 --> 00:50:02,728
Well...

532
00:50:03,103 --> 00:50:04,438
...Minas Tirith...

533
00:50:06,356 --> 00:50:07,774
...very impressive.

534
00:50:07,941 --> 00:50:10,569
-So where are we off to next?
-Oh, it's too late for that, Peregrin.

535
00:50:10,736 --> 00:50:12,946
There's no leaving this city.

536
00:50:15,282 --> 00:50:18,493
Help must come to us.

537
00:50:19,995 --> 00:50:22,664
It must be getting near teatime.

538
00:50:22,831 --> 00:50:26,543
Leastways, it would be in decent places
where there is still teatime.

539
00:50:26,710 --> 00:50:30,297
We're not in decent places.

540
00:50:35,844 --> 00:50:37,095
Mr. Frodo?

541
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:41,350
What is it?

542
00:50:43,810 --> 00:50:46,188
It's just a feeling.

543
00:50:48,607 --> 00:50:50,776
I don't think I'll be coming back.

544
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,824
Yes, you will. Of course you will.

545
00:50:58,450 --> 00:51:00,327
That's just morbid thinking.

546
00:51:00,786 --> 00:51:03,247
We're going there and back again...

547
00:51:03,413 --> 00:51:05,707
...just like Mr. Bilbo.

548
00:51:06,667 --> 00:51:08,794
You'll see.

549
00:51:16,969 --> 00:51:20,597
I think these lands were once
part of the kingdom of Gondor.

550
00:51:24,977 --> 00:51:29,022
Long ago, when there was a king.

551
00:51:49,668 --> 00:51:52,504
Mr. Frodo, look.

552
00:51:54,131 --> 00:51:56,883
The king has got a crown again.

553
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:12,274
Come on, Hobbits!
Mustn't stop now. This way.

554
00:52:29,124 --> 00:52:33,170
So I imagine this is just
a ceremonial position.

555
00:52:33,337 --> 00:52:37,591
I mean, they don't actually expect me
to do any fighting.

556
00:52:38,425 --> 00:52:41,678
-Do they?
-You're in the service of the steward now.

557
00:52:41,845 --> 00:52:45,223
You'll have to do as you're told,
Peregrin Took.

558
00:52:49,269 --> 00:52:51,772
Ridiculous Hobbit.

559
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:55,150
Guard of the Citadel.

560
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:06,495
Thank you.

561
00:53:15,879 --> 00:53:18,131
There's no more stars.

562
00:53:18,632 --> 00:53:19,841
Is it time?

563
00:53:21,009 --> 00:53:22,761
Yes.

564
00:53:25,389 --> 00:53:27,057
It's so quiet.

565
00:53:28,058 --> 00:53:32,312
It's the deep breath before the plunge.

566
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:36,358
I don't want to be in a battle...

567
00:53:37,192 --> 00:53:42,155
...but waiting on the edge of one
I can't escape is even worse.

568
00:53:45,701 --> 00:53:49,329
Is there any hope, Gandalf,
for Frodo and Sam?

569
00:53:50,664 --> 00:53:53,792
There never was much hope.

570
00:53:55,752 --> 00:53:57,504
Just a fool's hope.

571
00:54:03,385 --> 00:54:06,179
Our enemy is ready.

572
00:54:06,346 --> 00:54:09,016
His full strength's gathered.

573
00:54:09,182 --> 00:54:12,686
Not only Orcs, but Men as well.

574
00:54:12,853 --> 00:54:15,897
Legions of Haradrim from the south...

575
00:54:16,064 --> 00:54:18,775
...mercenaries from the coast.

576
00:54:18,942 --> 00:54:21,528
All will answer Mordor's call.

577
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:23,238
Come on.

578
00:54:24,364 --> 00:54:27,701
This will be the end of Gondor
as we know it.

579
00:54:27,868 --> 00:54:31,246
Here the hammer stroke will fall hardest.

580
00:54:32,205 --> 00:54:36,543
If the river is taken,
if the garrison at Osgiliath falls...

581
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:40,380
...the last defense of this city
will be gone.

582
00:54:40,547 --> 00:54:44,593
But we have the White Wizard.
That's got to count for something.

583
00:54:50,474 --> 00:54:52,059
Gandalf?

584
00:54:55,771 --> 00:54:59,441
Sauron has yet to reveal
his deadliest servant...

585
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:03,737
...the one who will lead
Mordor's armies in war.

586
00:55:03,904 --> 00:55:09,076
The one they say no living man can kill.

587
00:55:10,077 --> 00:55:12,246
The Witch King of Angmar.

588
00:55:13,330 --> 00:55:15,707
You've met him before.

589
00:55:16,375 --> 00:55:18,961
He stabbed Frodo on Weathertop.

590
00:55:25,509 --> 00:55:28,220
He is the lord of the Nazgûl...

591
00:55:28,679 --> 00:55:31,139
...the greatest of the Nine.

592
00:55:31,306 --> 00:55:34,935
Minas Morgul is his lair.

593
00:55:38,397 --> 00:55:41,942
The Dead City.

594
00:55:42,109 --> 00:55:47,322
Very nasty place. Full of enemies.

595
00:55:54,538 --> 00:55:56,707
Quick. Quick.

596
00:55:56,873 --> 00:56:00,877
They will see. They will see.

597
00:56:10,137 --> 00:56:15,434
Come away. Come away.
Look, we have found it.

598
00:56:15,601 --> 00:56:19,479
The way into Mordor.

599
00:56:19,646 --> 00:56:23,984
The secret stair.

600
00:56:24,401 --> 00:56:26,778
Climb.

601
00:56:47,049 --> 00:56:49,801
-No, Mr. Frodo!
-Not that way!

602
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:57,517
-What's it doing?
-No.

603
00:56:57,684 --> 00:57:00,771
-They're calling me.
-No.

604
00:57:30,425 --> 00:57:33,387
Hide! Hide!

605
00:58:16,930 --> 00:58:19,766
I can feel his blade.

606
00:58:31,445 --> 00:58:33,572
We come to it at last.

607
00:58:35,407 --> 00:58:38,285
The great battle of our time.

608
00:59:17,449 --> 00:59:20,702
Come away, Hobbits.
We climb. We must climb.

609
00:59:30,587 --> 00:59:33,590
The board is set.

610
00:59:33,757 --> 00:59:36,301
The pieces are moving.

611
00:59:38,845 --> 00:59:41,515
Up, up, up the stairs we go.

612
00:59:41,682 --> 00:59:44,351
And then it's into the tunnel.

613
00:59:44,518 --> 00:59:47,729
Hey, what's in this tunnel?

614
00:59:48,272 --> 00:59:51,024
You listen to me,
and you listen good and proper.

615
00:59:51,191 --> 00:59:54,111
Anything happens to him,
you have me to answer to.

616
00:59:54,278 --> 00:59:55,862
One sniff something's not right...

617
00:59:56,029 --> 00:59:59,199
...one hair stands up
on the back of my head, it's over.

618
00:59:59,408 --> 01:00:02,077
No more slinker. No more stinker.

619
01:00:02,411 --> 01:00:05,038
You're gone. Got it?

620
01:00:05,914 --> 01:00:07,916
I'm watching you.

621
01:00:13,255 --> 01:00:15,257
What was that about?

622
01:00:15,424 --> 01:00:17,843
Nothing. Just clearing something up.

623
01:00:24,474 --> 01:00:27,352
Peregrin Took, my lad,
there is a task now to be done.

624
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:32,107
Another opportunity for one
of the Shire-folk to prove their great worth.

625
01:00:36,945 --> 01:00:38,530
You must not fail me.

626
01:01:12,773 --> 01:01:15,859
It's been very quiet across the river.

627
01:01:16,026 --> 01:01:18,362
The Orcs are lying low.

628
01:01:18,528 --> 01:01:20,530
The garrison may have moved out.

629
01:01:21,657 --> 01:01:24,368
We've sent scouts to Cair Andros.

630
01:01:24,534 --> 01:01:27,829
If the Orcs attack from the north,
we'll have some warning.

631
01:01:53,146 --> 01:01:54,356
Quiet.

632
01:01:58,443 --> 01:02:00,404
We need 10 more.

633
01:02:21,717 --> 01:02:23,260
Kill him!

634
01:02:40,569 --> 01:02:42,988
They're not coming from the north.

635
01:02:44,406 --> 01:02:48,744
To the river. Quick. Quick.
Go. Come on.

636
01:02:52,205 --> 01:02:53,790
Faster.

637
01:03:06,929 --> 01:03:09,306
Draw swords.

638
01:04:03,860 --> 01:04:06,446
Hold! Hold them!

639
01:05:26,735 --> 01:05:28,612
What?

640
01:05:41,166 --> 01:05:42,584
Amon Dîn.

641
01:05:48,382 --> 01:05:51,426
The beacon.
The beacon of Amon Dîn is lit.

642
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:58,892
Hope is kindled.

643
01:07:31,276 --> 01:07:35,656
The beacons of Minas Tirith!
The beacons are lit!

644
01:07:36,865 --> 01:07:38,492
Gondor calls for aid.

645
01:07:49,002 --> 01:07:51,922
And Rohan will answer.

646
01:07:52,339 --> 01:07:55,133
Muster the Rohirrim.

647
01:08:10,232 --> 01:08:12,192
Assemble the army at Dunharrow.

648
01:08:12,359 --> 01:08:16,738
As many men as can be found.
You have two days.

649
01:08:16,905 --> 01:08:22,202
On the third,
we ride for Gondor and war.

650
01:08:23,161 --> 01:08:24,496
-Forward.
-Very good, sir.

651
01:08:24,663 --> 01:08:25,998
-Gamling.
-My lord.

652
01:08:26,164 --> 01:08:27,749
Make haste
across the Riddermark.

653
01:08:27,916 --> 01:08:30,043
Summon every able-bodied man
to Dunharrow.

654
01:08:30,210 --> 01:08:31,795
I will.

655
01:08:35,882 --> 01:08:39,052
-Will you ride with us?
-Just to the encampment.

656
01:08:39,219 --> 01:08:43,140
It's tradition for the women
of the court to farewell the men.

657
01:08:49,688 --> 01:08:51,607
The men have found their captain.

658
01:08:51,773 --> 01:08:55,110
They will follow you into battle,
even to death.

659
01:08:55,277 --> 01:08:56,862
You have given us hope.

660
01:09:00,073 --> 01:09:02,034
Excuse me.

661
01:09:03,368 --> 01:09:04,870
I have a sword.

662
01:09:05,162 --> 01:09:06,538
Please accept it.

663
01:09:07,664 --> 01:09:12,169
I offer you my service, Théoden King.

664
01:09:15,589 --> 01:09:17,674
And gladly I accept it.

665
01:09:18,759 --> 01:09:22,846
You shall be Meriadoc,
esquire of Rohan.

666
01:09:27,726 --> 01:09:28,936
Horse-Men.

667
01:09:29,603 --> 01:09:35,233
I wish I could muster a legion of Dwarves,
fully armed and filthy.

668
01:09:35,609 --> 01:09:38,570
Your kinsmen may have no need
to ride to war.

669
01:09:38,737 --> 01:09:42,157
I fear war already marches
on their own lands.

670
01:10:00,634 --> 01:10:04,096
So it is before the walls
of Minas Tirith...

671
01:10:04,263 --> 01:10:08,141
...the doom of our time will be decided.

672
01:10:10,727 --> 01:10:16,275
Now is the hour.
Riders of Rohan, oaths you have taken.

673
01:10:16,441 --> 01:10:19,987
Now, fulfill them all.
To lord and land!

674
01:11:03,071 --> 01:11:04,632
Faramir!

675
01:11:04,970 --> 01:11:14,459
<i><font color="#008000">♫ Ored, gwanwen ost in giliath</font></i>
<i><font color="#FFFF00">(No warning, the citadel of the stars is gone)</font></i>

676
01:11:11,330 --> 01:11:15,042
We can't hold them. The city is lost.

677
01:11:14,970 --> 01:11:26,459
<i><font color="#008000">♫ Dannen Osgiliath</font></i>
<i><font color="#FFFF00">(Osgiliath has fallen)</font></i>

678
01:11:15,626 --> 01:11:18,712
Tell the men to break cover.
We ride for Minas Tirith.

679
01:11:27,471 --> 01:11:29,723
Nazgûl.

680
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:34,561
Take cover!

681
01:11:34,728 --> 01:11:37,272
Nazgûl!

682
01:11:37,439 --> 01:11:41,109
Fall back. Fall back to Minas Tirith!

683
01:11:47,699 --> 01:11:49,576
Fall back!

684
01:11:56,625 --> 01:12:01,213
-Retreat! Retreat!
-Run for your lives!

685
01:12:25,445 --> 01:12:29,783
The age of Men is over.

686
01:12:29,950 --> 01:12:35,581
The time of the Orc has come.

687
01:12:37,958 --> 01:12:40,294
-Keep going.
-It's the Nazgûl.

688
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:44,298
Take cover, my lord!

689
01:12:44,590 --> 01:12:45,924
It's coming!

690
01:12:51,471 --> 01:12:54,850
-It's Mithrandir.
-The White Rider!

691
01:13:14,970 --> 01:13:21,459

694
01:13:34,806 --> 01:13:36,183
Pull!

695
01:13:53,909 --> 01:13:56,328
Mithrandir.

696
01:13:56,495 --> 01:13:58,247
They broke through our defenses.

697
01:13:58,413 --> 01:14:00,624
They've taken the bridge
and the west bank.

698
01:14:01,708 --> 01:14:05,879
-Battalions of Orcs are crossing the river.
-It is as the Lord Denethor predicted.

699
01:14:06,046 --> 01:14:10,592
-Long has he foreseen this doom.
-Foreseen and done nothing.

700
01:14:13,971 --> 01:14:16,390
Faramir?

701
01:14:18,308 --> 01:14:22,145
This is not the first Halfling
to have crossed your path.

702
01:14:22,312 --> 01:14:24,523
No.

703
01:14:25,857 --> 01:14:27,401
You've seen Frodo and Sam?

704
01:14:28,277 --> 01:14:31,697
-Where? When?
-In Ithilien.

705
01:14:31,863 --> 01:14:33,949
Not two days ago.

706
01:14:34,408 --> 01:14:38,870
Gandalf, they're taking the road
to the Morgul Vale.

707
01:14:39,580 --> 01:14:42,207
And then the pass of Cirith Ungol.

708
01:14:44,418 --> 01:14:46,795
What does that mean?

709
01:14:46,962 --> 01:14:51,883
-What's wrong?
-Faramir, tell me everything.

710
01:14:52,050 --> 01:14:54,094
Tell me all you know.

711
01:14:55,262 --> 01:14:58,682
This is how you would serve your city?

712
01:14:58,849 --> 01:15:02,144
You would risk its utter ruin?

713
01:15:03,186 --> 01:15:04,771
I did what I judged to be right.

714
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:08,483
What you judged to be right.

715
01:15:09,109 --> 01:15:14,990
You sent the Ring of Power into Mordor
in the hands of a witless Halfling.

716
01:15:18,952 --> 01:15:23,790
It should have been brought back
to the Citadel to be kept safe.

717
01:15:25,417 --> 01:15:26,960
Hidden.

718
01:15:27,377 --> 01:15:30,130
Dark and deep in the vaults...

719
01:15:30,297 --> 01:15:32,466
...not to be used.

720
01:15:36,637 --> 01:15:41,516
Unless at the uttermost end of need.

721
01:15:41,975 --> 01:15:44,019
I would not use the Ring.

722
01:15:44,186 --> 01:15:47,272
Not if Minas Tirith were falling in ruin
and I alone could save her.

723
01:15:47,606 --> 01:15:52,444
Ever you desire to appear lordly
and gracious...

724
01:15:52,611 --> 01:15:54,863
...as a king of old.

725
01:15:56,657 --> 01:16:00,410
Boromir would have remembered
his father's need.

726
01:16:00,827 --> 01:16:03,288
He would have brought me a kingly gift.

727
01:16:03,497 --> 01:16:06,041
Boromir would not
have brought the Ring.

728
01:16:06,458 --> 01:16:09,586
He would have stretched out his hand to
this thing and taken it. He would've fallen.

729
01:16:09,753 --> 01:16:12,005
-You know nothing of this matter!
-He would have kept it for his own.

730
01:16:13,882 --> 01:16:16,051
And when he returned...

731
01:16:17,177 --> 01:16:18,845
...you would not have known your son.

732
01:16:19,012 --> 01:16:21,556
Boromir was loyal to me!

733
01:16:21,723 --> 01:16:24,309
Not some wizard's pupil!

734
01:16:32,442 --> 01:16:33,777
Father?

735
01:16:46,456 --> 01:16:48,375
My son.

736
01:17:14,610 --> 01:17:15,986
Leave me.

737
01:17:49,561 --> 01:17:52,105
Careful, master. Careful.

738
01:17:52,439 --> 01:17:55,359
Very far to fall.

739
01:17:57,861 --> 01:18:01,782
Very dangerous are the stairs.

740
01:18:04,451 --> 01:18:06,995
Come, master.

741
01:18:12,793 --> 01:18:15,963
Come to Sméagol.

742
01:18:22,302 --> 01:18:23,804
Mr. Frodo.

743
01:18:24,805 --> 01:18:26,348
Get back, you!

744
01:18:26,515 --> 01:18:28,725
Don't touch him!

745
01:18:32,854 --> 01:18:35,691
Why does he hates poor Sméagol?

746
01:18:35,857 --> 01:18:39,570
What has Sméagol ever done to him?

747
01:18:39,736 --> 01:18:42,114
Master?

748
01:18:42,906 --> 01:18:46,368
Master carries heavy burden.

749
01:18:46,535 --> 01:18:51,957
Sméagol knows.
Heavy, heavy burden.

750
01:18:52,124 --> 01:18:55,377
Fat one cannot know.

751
01:18:57,421 --> 01:19:00,173
Sméagol look after master.

752
01:19:01,383 --> 01:19:03,594
He wants it.

753
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:08,307
He needs it.
Sméagol sees it in his eye.

754
01:19:08,473 --> 01:19:13,937
Very soon he will ask you for it.
You will see.

755
01:19:14,104 --> 01:19:17,983
The fat one will take it from you.

756
01:19:25,198 --> 01:19:29,536
Send forth all legions.

757
01:19:29,703 --> 01:19:33,749
Do not stop the attack
until the city is taken.

758
01:19:34,458 --> 01:19:37,586
Slay them all.

759
01:19:39,254 --> 01:19:45,052
-What of the wizard?
-I will break him.

760
01:19:48,388 --> 01:19:50,807
Where are Théoden's riders?

761
01:19:50,974 --> 01:19:53,560
Will Rohan's army come?

762
01:19:53,727 --> 01:19:55,979
Mithrandir.

763
01:19:57,022 --> 01:20:00,901
Courage is the best defense
that you have now.

764
01:20:05,697 --> 01:20:08,408
What were you thinking, Peregrin Took?

765
01:20:10,494 --> 01:20:16,208
What service can a Hobbit
offer such a great lord of Men?

766
01:20:16,375 --> 01:20:17,876
It was well-done.

767
01:20:21,046 --> 01:20:25,092
A generous deed should not
be checked with cold counsel.

768
01:20:25,842 --> 01:20:28,387
You are to join the tower guard.

769
01:20:28,929 --> 01:20:31,932
I didn't think they would find any livery
that would fit me.

770
01:20:32,099 --> 01:20:34,559
Once belonged to a young boy
of the city.

771
01:20:34,726 --> 01:20:36,270
A very foolish one...

772
01:20:36,436 --> 01:20:40,691
...who wasted many hours slaying dragons
instead of attending to his studies.

773
01:20:40,857 --> 01:20:43,610
-This was yours?
-Yes, it was mine.

774
01:20:43,777 --> 01:20:45,571
My father had it made for me.

775
01:20:46,613 --> 01:20:47,948
Well...

776
01:20:48,115 --> 01:20:50,117
...I'm taller than you were then.

777
01:20:50,284 --> 01:20:53,620
Though I'm not likely to grow anymore,
except sideways.

778
01:20:56,582 --> 01:20:58,625
Never fitted me either.

779
01:20:58,792 --> 01:21:01,628
Boromir was always the soldier.

780
01:21:04,631 --> 01:21:07,050
They were so alike, he and my father.

781
01:21:09,136 --> 01:21:10,762
Proud.

782
01:21:10,929 --> 01:21:12,139
Stubborn even.

783
01:21:13,890 --> 01:21:15,392
But strong.

784
01:21:16,893 --> 01:21:20,063
I think you have strength
of a different kind.

785
01:21:20,689 --> 01:21:23,150
And one day your father will see it.

786
01:21:27,321 --> 01:21:31,116
Here do I swear fealty
and service to Gondor...

787
01:21:31,283 --> 01:21:32,784
...in peace or war...

788
01:21:33,410 --> 01:21:35,871
...in living or dying...

789
01:21:37,247 --> 01:21:38,498
...from...

790
01:21:41,168 --> 01:21:43,962
From this hour henceforth...

791
01:21:44,129 --> 01:21:46,048
...until my lord release me...

792
01:21:47,549 --> 01:21:49,760
...or death take me.

793
01:21:50,344 --> 01:21:52,846
And I shall not forget it...

794
01:21:53,013 --> 01:21:56,391
...nor fail to reward
that which is given.

795
01:22:03,982 --> 01:22:06,276
Fealty with love.

796
01:22:07,361 --> 01:22:09,029
Valour with honour.

797
01:22:10,614 --> 01:22:13,951
Disloyalty with vengeance.

798
01:22:22,584 --> 01:22:26,672
I do not think we should so lightly
abandon the outer defenses...

799
01:22:26,838 --> 01:22:29,591
...defenses that your brother
long held intact.

800
01:22:29,758 --> 01:22:32,261
-What would you have me do?
-I will not yield...

801
01:22:32,427 --> 01:22:35,222
...the river in Pelennor unfought.

802
01:22:35,389 --> 01:22:37,057
Osgiliath must be retaken.

803
01:22:37,224 --> 01:22:39,268
My lord, Osgiliath is overrun.

804
01:22:39,935 --> 01:22:42,729
Much must be risked in war.

805
01:22:45,357 --> 01:22:49,319
Is there a captain here who still has
the courage to do his lord's will?

806
01:22:55,534 --> 01:22:58,787
You wish now that our places
had been exchanged...

807
01:22:59,746 --> 01:23:02,583
...that I had died
and Boromir had lived.

808
01:23:06,003 --> 01:23:07,754
Yes.

809
01:23:08,422 --> 01:23:10,632
I wish that.

810
01:23:19,016 --> 01:23:21,518
Since you were robbed
of Boromir...

811
01:23:23,353 --> 01:23:26,273
...I will do what I can
in his stead.

812
01:23:34,448 --> 01:23:38,911
If I should return,
think better of me, Father.

813
01:23:40,996 --> 01:23:44,625
That will depend on the manner
of your return.

814
01:25:07,916 --> 01:25:10,252
What are you up to?

815
01:25:10,419 --> 01:25:11,670
Sneaking off, are we?

816
01:25:12,379 --> 01:25:14,214
Sneaking?

817
01:25:15,215 --> 01:25:17,384
Sneaking?

818
01:25:18,802 --> 01:25:21,972
Fat Hobbit is always so polite.

819
01:25:22,139 --> 01:25:27,227
Sméagol shows them secret ways
that nobody else could find...

820
01:25:27,394 --> 01:25:29,563
...and they say "sneak."

821
01:25:30,188 --> 01:25:32,774
Sneak?

822
01:25:33,400 --> 01:25:36,111
Very nice friend.
Oh, yes, my precious.

823
01:25:36,278 --> 01:25:38,906
-Very nice, very nice.
-All right. All right!

824
01:25:40,157 --> 01:25:42,367
You just startled me is all.

825
01:25:42,868 --> 01:25:44,703
What were you doing?

826
01:25:46,330 --> 01:25:48,457
Sneaking.

827
01:25:48,832 --> 01:25:51,919
Fine. Have it your own way.

828
01:25:54,171 --> 01:25:56,673
I'm sorry to wake you, Mr. Frodo.

829
01:25:57,049 --> 01:25:59,009
We have to be moving on.

830
01:26:04,181 --> 01:26:05,766
It's dark still.

831
01:26:05,933 --> 01:26:08,143
It's always dark here.

832
01:26:12,397 --> 01:26:14,316
It's gone!

833
01:26:15,525 --> 01:26:18,403
-The Elven bread.
-What?

834
01:26:18,570 --> 01:26:20,030
That's all we have left.

835
01:26:24,117 --> 01:26:26,620
He took it. He must have!

836
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:30,374
Sméagol?
No, no, not poor Sméagol.

837
01:26:30,540 --> 01:26:33,460
Sméagol hates nasty Elf bread.

838
01:26:33,627 --> 01:26:36,797
You're a lying rat!
What did you do with it?!

839
01:26:36,964 --> 01:26:38,507
He doesn't eat it.

840
01:26:39,508 --> 01:26:41,843
-He can't have taken it.
-Look.

841
01:26:42,886 --> 01:26:44,721
What's this?

842
01:26:47,391 --> 01:26:50,727
Crumbs on his jacketses.
He took it!

843
01:26:51,436 --> 01:26:53,105
He took it.

844
01:26:53,939 --> 01:26:58,151
I seen him. He's always stuffing
his face when master's not looking.

845
01:26:58,318 --> 01:27:00,112
That's a filthy lie!

846
01:27:00,279 --> 01:27:02,489
You stinking, two-faced sneak!

847
01:27:02,656 --> 01:27:03,907
-Sam!
-Call me...

848
01:27:04,074 --> 01:27:05,325
Stop it!

849
01:27:06,326 --> 01:27:07,536
Sam!

850
01:27:08,829 --> 01:27:12,457
-I'll kill him!
-Sam! No!

851
01:27:13,500 --> 01:27:19,047
Oh, my... I'm sorry. I didn't mean it
to go so far. I was just so... So angry.

852
01:27:19,214 --> 01:27:21,341
Here, just...
Let's just rest a bit.

853
01:27:21,508 --> 01:27:23,594
-I'm all right.
-No.

854
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:26,847
No, you're not all right.
You're exhausted.

855
01:27:27,014 --> 01:27:29,141
It's that Gollum.

856
01:27:29,308 --> 01:27:31,018
It's this place.

857
01:27:31,184 --> 01:27:33,770
It's that thing around your neck.

858
01:27:37,274 --> 01:27:38,567
I could help a bit.

859
01:27:38,734 --> 01:27:41,403
I could carry it for a while.

860
01:27:41,570 --> 01:27:43,322
Carry it for a while.

861
01:27:43,488 --> 01:27:44,740
I could carry it... I could carry it.

862
01:27:45,365 --> 01:27:50,829
Share the load... Share the load...
the load... the load.

863
01:27:50,996 --> 01:27:52,205
Get away!

864
01:27:52,372 --> 01:27:53,957
I don't want to keep it.

865
01:27:57,544 --> 01:27:59,546
I just want to help.

866
01:28:01,590 --> 01:28:04,217
See? See?

867
01:28:04,384 --> 01:28:07,804
He wants it for himself.

868
01:28:07,971 --> 01:28:09,681
Shut up, you!

869
01:28:10,223 --> 01:28:12,059
Go away!
Get out of here!

870
01:28:12,225 --> 01:28:14,061
No, Sam.

871
01:28:14,227 --> 01:28:15,479
It's you.

872
01:28:19,691 --> 01:28:21,401
I'm sorry, Sam.

873
01:28:23,070 --> 01:28:24,446
But he's a liar.

874
01:28:24,613 --> 01:28:27,282
He's poisoned you against me.

875
01:28:28,700 --> 01:28:30,619
You can't help me anymore.

876
01:28:32,579 --> 01:28:34,456
You don't mean that.

877
01:28:36,959 --> 01:28:38,752
Go home.

878
01:29:58,790 --> 01:30:00,584
Faramir!

879
01:30:00,751 --> 01:30:02,669
Faramir!

880
01:30:04,171 --> 01:30:06,214
Your father's will has turned
to madness.

881
01:30:07,382 --> 01:30:09,426
Do not throw away your life
so rashly.

882
01:30:10,177 --> 01:30:12,512
Where does my allegiance lie
if not here?

883
01:30:13,138 --> 01:30:16,058
This is the city of the Men of Nûmenor.

884
01:30:16,683 --> 01:30:19,478
I will gladly give my life
to defend her beauty...

885
01:30:19,645 --> 01:30:22,856
...her memory, her wisdom.

886
01:30:25,234 --> 01:30:28,654
Your father loves you, Faramir.

887
01:30:29,363 --> 01:30:32,366
He will remember it
before the end.

888
01:31:41,977 --> 01:31:43,520
Can you sing, Master Hobbit?

889
01:31:46,398 --> 01:31:47,900
Well...

890
01:31:48,442 --> 01:31:50,068
...yes.

891
01:31:50,777 --> 01:31:54,531
At least, well enough
for my own people.

892
01:31:56,158 --> 01:31:58,577
But we have no songs
for great halls...

893
01:31:59,620 --> 01:32:00,871
...and evil times.

894
01:32:01,705 --> 01:32:04,875
And why should your songs
be unfit for my halls?

895
01:32:07,669 --> 01:32:09,087
Come, sing me a song.

896
01:32:20,140 --> 01:32:23,477
<i>Home is behind</i>

897
01:32:23,644 --> 01:32:27,397
<i>The world ahead</i>

898
01:32:29,816 --> 01:32:35,656
<i>And there are many paths to tread</i>

899
01:32:37,449 --> 01:32:40,994
<i>Through shadow</i>

900
01:32:41,161 --> 01:32:45,332
<i>To the edge of night</i>

901
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:52,089
<i>Until the stars are all alight</i>

902
01:32:55,092 --> 01:32:59,429
<i>Mist and shadow</i>

903
01:32:59,596 --> 01:33:03,892
<i>Cloud and shade</i>

904
01:33:06,270 --> 01:33:09,606
<i>All shall fade</i>

905
01:33:11,984 --> 01:33:15,988
<i>All shall</i>

906
01:33:21,743 --> 01:33:24,121
<i>Fade</i>

907
01:33:48,520 --> 01:33:51,982
March! March!

908
01:33:52,149 --> 01:33:57,362
March! March! March!

909
01:34:00,824 --> 01:34:03,160
Make way for the king.

910
01:34:04,661 --> 01:34:06,663
Make way.

911
01:34:09,124 --> 01:34:11,168
The king is here.

912
01:34:13,128 --> 01:34:14,755
My lord.

913
01:34:16,006 --> 01:34:17,966
Hail to you, sire.

914
01:34:18,425 --> 01:34:19,635
Grimbold, how many?

915
01:34:19,801 --> 01:34:22,262
I bring 500 men from the Westfold,
my lord.

916
01:34:23,221 --> 01:34:25,891
We have 300 more from Fenmarch,
Théoden King.

917
01:34:27,017 --> 01:34:30,979
-Where are the riders from Snowbourn?
-None have come, my lord.

918
01:34:48,038 --> 01:34:50,165
Six thousand spears.

919
01:34:51,208 --> 01:34:53,210
Less than half of what I'd hoped for.

920
01:34:53,502 --> 01:34:56,880
Six thousand will not be enough
to break the lines of Mordor.

921
01:34:59,633 --> 01:35:01,385
More will come.

922
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:04,721
Every hour lost hastens Gondor's defeat.

923
01:35:04,888 --> 01:35:07,474
We have till dawn,
then we must ride.

924
01:35:26,952 --> 01:35:29,288
The horses are restless...

925
01:35:29,454 --> 01:35:30,956
...and the men are quiet.

926
01:35:31,415 --> 01:35:34,543
They grow nervous in the shadow
of the mountain.

927
01:35:37,004 --> 01:35:38,880
That road there...

928
01:35:39,798 --> 01:35:41,883
...where does that lead?

929
01:35:42,634 --> 01:35:46,471
It is the road to the Dimholt,
the door under the mountain.

930
01:35:47,180 --> 01:35:50,183
None who venture there ever return.

931
01:35:51,393 --> 01:35:53,270
That mountain is evil.


932
01:35:55,970 --> 01:36:16,459
<i><font color="#008000">♫ Go vegil tolo hí 'ni men 'war</font></i>
<i><font color="#FFFF00">(Come armed, no other end to this road)</font></i>

933
01:36:16,209 --> 01:36:18,045
Aragorn.

934
01:36:18,795 --> 01:36:20,714
Let's find some food.

935
01:36:37,189 --> 01:36:38,607
There.

936
01:36:39,566 --> 01:36:42,569
A true esquire of Rohan.

937
01:36:46,198 --> 01:36:48,200
I'm ready.

938
01:36:49,785 --> 01:36:51,078
Sorry.

939
01:36:51,245 --> 01:36:53,497
It isn't all that dangerous.

940
01:36:53,997 --> 01:36:56,333
It's not even sharp.

941
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:00,420
Well, that's no good. You won't kill
many Orcs with a blunt blade.

942
01:37:00,587 --> 01:37:02,089
Come on.

943
01:37:06,260 --> 01:37:08,762
To the smithy. Go!

944
01:37:10,222 --> 01:37:12,766
You should not encourage him.

945
01:37:12,933 --> 01:37:15,394
You should not doubt him.

946
01:37:15,561 --> 01:37:18,855
I do not doubt his heart,
only the reach of his arm.

947
01:37:21,567 --> 01:37:23,151
Why should Merry be left behind?

948
01:37:23,318 --> 01:37:25,946
He has as much cause
to go to war as you.

949
01:37:28,115 --> 01:37:31,285
Why can he not fight
for those he loves?

950
01:37:34,538 --> 01:37:37,541
You know as little of war
as that Hobbit.

951
01:37:38,792 --> 01:37:40,877
When the fear takes him...

952
01:37:41,044 --> 01:37:46,091
...and the blood and the screams
and the horror of battle take hold...

953
01:37:46,466 --> 01:37:48,635
...do you think he would stand and fight?

954
01:37:51,179 --> 01:37:52,806
He would flee.

955
01:37:52,973 --> 01:37:55,017
And he would be right to do so.

956
01:37:57,227 --> 01:38:01,189
War is the province of Men, Éowyn.

957
01:38:36,850 --> 01:38:40,562
I choose a mortal life.

958
01:38:43,482 --> 01:38:46,360
I wish I could've seen him...

959
01:38:47,486 --> 01:38:50,197
...one last time.

960
01:39:01,375 --> 01:39:02,793
Sir?

961
01:39:04,628 --> 01:39:07,214
King Théoden awaits you, my lord.

962
01:39:27,985 --> 01:39:29,945
I take my leave.

963
01:39:44,585 --> 01:39:45,836
My lord Elrond.

964
01:39:46,420 --> 01:39:49,923
I come on behalf of one whom I love.

965
01:39:53,010 --> 01:39:55,012
Arwen is dying.

966
01:39:59,808 --> 01:40:03,854
She will not long survive the evil
that now spreads from Mordor.

967
01:40:04,605 --> 01:40:07,983
The light of the Evenstar is failing.

968
01:40:08,150 --> 01:40:12,154
As Sauron's power grows,
her strength wanes.

969
01:40:12,321 --> 01:40:16,074
Arwen's life is now tied
to the fate of the Ring.

970
01:40:16,825 --> 01:40:19,411
The Shadow is upon us, Aragorn.

971
01:40:19,786 --> 01:40:21,455
The end has come.

972
01:40:21,830 --> 01:40:24,458
It will not be our end, but his.

973
01:40:25,208 --> 01:40:28,795
You ride to war, but not to victory.

974
01:40:29,796 --> 01:40:33,467
Sauron's armies march on Minas Tirith,
this you know.

975
01:40:33,634 --> 01:40:38,055
But in secret he sends another force
which will attack from the river.

976
01:40:38,513 --> 01:40:41,934
<i>A fleet of Corsair ships sails
from the south.</i>

977
01:40:42,559 --> 01:40:44,645
They'll be in the city in two days.

978
01:40:45,145 --> 01:40:47,981
You're outnumbered, Aragorn.

979
01:40:48,690 --> 01:40:50,817
You need more men.

980
01:40:51,193 --> 01:40:52,945
There are none.

981
01:40:54,696 --> 01:40:58,617
There are those who dwell
in the mountain.

982
01:41:07,626 --> 01:41:09,795
Murderers...

983
01:41:09,962 --> 01:41:11,380
...traitors.

984
01:41:13,840 --> 01:41:16,009
You would call upon them to fight?

985
01:41:16,176 --> 01:41:17,761
They believe in nothing.

986
01:41:17,928 --> 01:41:20,055
They answer to no one.

987
01:41:20,222 --> 01:41:23,308
They will answer
to the king of Gondor.

988
01:41:23,970 --> 01:41:32,459
<i><font color="#008000">♫ Elo! Andúril</font></i>
<i><font color="#FFFF00">(Behold! Andúril)</font></i>

989
01:41:30,440 --> 01:41:35,571
Andûril, the Flame of the West,
forged from the shards of Narsil.

990
01:41:49,876 --> 01:41:54,298
Sauron will not have forgotten
the Sword of Elendil.

991
01:42:08,353 --> 01:42:13,108
The blade that was broken
shall return to Minas Tirith.

992
01:42:13,275 --> 01:42:15,694
The man who can wield
the power of this sword...

993
01:42:15,861 --> 01:42:19,740
...can summon to him an army more
deadly than any that walks this earth.

994
01:42:21,575 --> 01:42:23,744
Put aside the Ranger.

995
01:42:23,911 --> 01:42:27,247
Become who you were born to be.

996
01:42:27,414 --> 01:42:29,416
Take the Dimholt road.

997
01:42:33,420 --> 01:42:36,214

999
01:42:55,442 --> 01:42:57,110
Why are you doing this?

1000
01:42:57,569 --> 01:43:00,781
The war lies to the east.
You cannot leave on the eve of battle.

1001
01:43:03,200 --> 01:43:05,285
You cannot abandon the men.

1002
01:43:06,578 --> 01:43:08,163
Éowyn...

1003
01:43:08,330 --> 01:43:10,540
We need you here.

1004
01:43:11,667 --> 01:43:13,543
Why have you come?

1005
01:43:15,212 --> 01:43:17,172
Do you not know?

1006
01:43:26,473 --> 01:43:29,476
It is but a shadow and a thought
that you love.

1007
01:43:33,397 --> 01:43:35,816
I cannot give you what you seek.

1008
01:43:49,329 --> 01:43:53,250
I have wished you joy
since first I saw you.

1009
01:44:12,394 --> 01:44:14,688
Just where do you think
you're off to?

1010
01:44:14,855 --> 01:44:16,189
Not this time.

1011
01:44:16,356 --> 01:44:18,567
This time you must stay, Gimli.

1012
01:44:21,278 --> 01:44:24,114
Have you learned nothing
of the stubbornness of Dwarves?

1013
01:44:24,281 --> 01:44:27,951
You might as well accept it.
We're going with you, laddie.

1014
01:44:50,265 --> 01:44:52,434
-What's happening?
-Where is he going?

1015
01:44:52,768 --> 01:44:54,645
Where's he going?

1016
01:44:57,231 --> 01:44:59,274
I don't understand.

1017
01:45:03,695 --> 01:45:05,489
Lord Aragorn!

1018
01:45:05,906 --> 01:45:08,617
Why does he leave on the eve of battle?

1019
01:45:09,826 --> 01:45:11,912
He leaves because there is no hope.

1020
01:45:12,579 --> 01:45:14,706
He leaves because he must.

1021
01:45:14,873 --> 01:45:16,583
Too few have come.

1022
01:45:16,750 --> 01:45:18,919
We cannot defeat
the armies of Mordor.

1023
01:45:21,421 --> 01:45:23,090
No...

1024
01:45:23,507 --> 01:45:24,758
...we cannot.

1025
01:45:27,636 --> 01:45:31,431
But we will meet them
in battle nonetheless.

1026
01:45:45,862 --> 01:45:47,614
I have left instruction.

1027
01:45:50,284 --> 01:45:53,537
The people are to follow
your rule in my stead.

1028
01:46:00,127 --> 01:46:02,379
Take up my seat in the Golden Hall.

1029
01:46:03,630 --> 01:46:06,466
Long may you defend Edoras...

1030
01:46:06,633 --> 01:46:08,969
...if the battle goes ill.

1031
01:46:10,053 --> 01:46:13,473
What other duty would you
have me do, my lord?

1032
01:46:15,684 --> 01:46:17,644
Duty?

1033
01:46:19,813 --> 01:46:21,148
No.

1034
01:46:29,448 --> 01:46:31,575
I would have you smile again...

1035
01:46:34,995 --> 01:46:40,000
...not grieve for those
whose time has come.

1036
01:46:44,838 --> 01:46:48,342
You shall live to see
these days renewed...

1037
01:46:52,679 --> 01:46:55,432
...and no more despair.

1038

<i><font color="#FFFF00">(The way is shut)</font></i>

1039
01:47:01,647 --> 01:47:05,359
What kind of army would linger
in such a place?

1040
01:47:05,525 --> 01:47:07,361
One that is cursed.

1042
01:47:09,871 --> 01:47:11,865
Long ago, the Men of the Mountains
swore an oath...

1043
01:47:12,282 --> 01:47:15,035
...to the last king of Gondor...

1044
01:47:15,619 --> 01:47:17,204
...to come to his aid...

1045
01:47:17,371 --> 01:47:19,081
...to fight.

1046
01:47:19,581 --> 01:47:21,750
But when the time came...

...they fled...

1050
01:47:27,214 --> 01:47:30,592
...vanishing into the darkness
of the mountain.

1051
01:47:31,635 --> 01:47:33,971
And so Isildur cursed them...


1052

...never to rest until they had
fulfilled their pledge.

1054
01:47:43,689 --> 01:47:46,858
Who shall call them
from the grey twilight?

1055
01:47:47,317 --> 01:47:49,570
The forgotten people.

1056
01:47:49,736 --> 01:47:52,239
The heir of him to whom
the oath they swore.

1057
01:47:52,698 --> 01:47:54,575
From the north shall he come.

1058
01:47:55,075 --> 01:47:56,743
Need shall drive him.

1059
01:47:57,828 --> 01:48:01,331
He shall pass the door
to the Paths of the Dead.

1060
01:48:19,808 --> 01:48:23,103
The very warmth of my blood
seems stolen away.

1061
01:48:28,650 --> 01:48:30,611
The way is shut.

1062
01:48:31,361 --> 01:48:33,322
It was made by those
who are dead.

1063
01:48:33,947 --> 01:48:36,199
And the Dead keep it.

Brego!

1066
01:48:54,635 --> 01:48:57,346
I do not fear death.

1067
01:49:09,650 --> 01:49:12,069
Well, this is a thing unheard-of.

1068
01:49:12,236 --> 01:49:16,907
An Elf will go underground
where a Dwarf dare not?

1069
01:49:17,074 --> 01:49:18,408
Oh.

1070
01:49:18,575 --> 01:49:21,411
Oh, I'd never hear the end of it.

1071
01:49:36,426 --> 01:49:38,679
We must ride light and swift.

1072
01:49:38,845 --> 01:49:40,597
It is a long road ahead.

1073
01:49:40,764 --> 01:49:43,850
And man and beast must reach the end
with the strength to fight.

1074
01:49:49,356 --> 01:49:52,359
Little Hobbits do not belong in war,
Master Meriadoc.

1075
01:49:52,693 --> 01:49:54,695
All my friends have gone to battle.

1076
01:49:54,861 --> 01:49:56,738
I would be ashamed to be left behind.

1077
01:49:56,905 --> 01:49:59,032
It is a three-day gallop to Minas Tirith.

1078
01:49:59,199 --> 01:50:01,577
And none of my riders can bear you
as a burden.

1079
01:50:02,578 --> 01:50:04,705
I want to fight.

1080
01:50:05,205 --> 01:50:07,207
I will say no more.

1081
01:50:24,016 --> 01:50:25,976
Ride with me.

1082
01:50:27,436 --> 01:50:28,854
My lady.

1083
01:50:29,021 --> 01:50:31,398
Form up! Move out!

1084
01:50:31,565 --> 01:50:34,776
Form up! Move out!

1085
01:50:37,863 --> 01:50:39,072
Ride!

1086
01:50:39,239 --> 01:50:42,200
Ride now to Gondor!

1088
01:51:23,825 --> 01:51:25,577
What is it?

1089
01:51:25,744 --> 01:51:27,287
What do you see?

1090
01:51:27,537 --> 01:51:29,665
I see shapes of men.

1091
01:51:32,334 --> 01:51:33,710
And of horses.

1092
01:51:34,461 --> 01:51:35,671
Where?

1093
01:51:35,837 --> 01:51:38,799
Pale banners like shreds of cloud.

1094
01:51:41,218 --> 01:51:43,428
Spears rise...

1095
01:51:44,054 --> 01:51:47,516
...like winter-thickets
through a shroud of mist.

1096
01:51:48,767 --> 01:51:50,936
The Dead are following.

1097
01:51:52,145 --> 01:51:53,647
They have been summoned.

1098
01:51:54,314 --> 01:51:56,149
The Dead?

1099
01:51:56,525 --> 01:51:58,235
Summoned?

1100
01:51:58,652 --> 01:52:00,529
I knew that.

1101
01:52:03,865 --> 01:52:05,617
Very good.

1102
01:52:06,326 --> 01:52:08,412
Very good! Legolas!

1103
01:52:46,366 --> 01:52:47,784
Do not look down.

1104
01:53:40,379 --> 01:53:45,509
Who enters my domain?

1105
01:53:49,263 --> 01:53:51,473
One who will have your allegiance.

1106
01:53:54,434 --> 01:53:59,773
The Dead do not suffer the living to pass.

1107
01:54:00,107 --> 01:54:02,776
You will suffer me.

1108
01:54:26,300 --> 01:54:29,678
The way is shut.

1109
01:54:30,846 --> 01:54:35,309
It was made by those who are dead.

1110
01:54:35,684 --> 01:54:39,855
And the Dead keep it.

1111
01:54:48,989 --> 01:54:52,075
The way is shut.

1112
01:54:53,827 --> 01:54:56,455
Now you must die.

1113
01:55:00,334 --> 01:55:03,170
I summon you to fulfill your oath.

1114
01:55:03,503 --> 01:55:08,467
None but the king of Gondor
may command me.

1115
01:55:14,056 --> 01:55:16,225
That line was broken.

1116
01:55:18,852 --> 01:55:21,063
It has been remade.

1117
01:55:28,987 --> 01:55:30,530
Fight for us...

1118
01:55:30,697 --> 01:55:33,242
...and regain your honour.

1119
01:55:37,412 --> 01:55:38,747
What say you?

1120
01:55:50,968 --> 01:55:52,511
What say you?

1121
01:55:53,262 --> 01:55:55,055
You waste your time, Aragorn.

1122
01:55:55,222 --> 01:55:58,392
They had no honour in life,
they have none now in death.

1123
01:55:58,892 --> 01:56:01,395
I am Isildur's heir.

1124
01:56:01,937 --> 01:56:03,897
Fight for me...

1125
01:56:04,481 --> 01:56:08,068
...and I will hold your oaths fulfilled.

1126
01:56:11,989 --> 01:56:13,949
What say you?

1127
01:56:21,873 --> 01:56:24,084
You have my word!

1128
01:56:24,376 --> 01:56:28,380
Fight, and I will release you
from this living death!

1129
01:56:29,840 --> 01:56:31,341
What say you?!

1130
01:56:34,636 --> 01:56:37,598
Stand, you traitors!

1131
01:57:04,541 --> 01:57:05,584
Out!

1132
01:57:26,939 --> 01:57:28,523
Legolas!

1133
01:57:29,650 --> 01:57:30,859
Run!

1134
01:57:50,970 --> 01:58:10,459

We fight.

<font color="#FF0000">Gurut!</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">(Death!)</font>

1138
01:58:49,605 --> 01:58:52,190
Open the gate! Quick!

1139
01:59:23,222 --> 01:59:25,224
Quick! Hurry!

1140
01:59:38,987 --> 01:59:40,614
Faramir!

1141
01:59:41,615 --> 01:59:44,868
Say not that he has fallen.

1142
01:59:46,036 --> 01:59:47,579
They were outnumbered.

1143
01:59:47,996 --> 01:59:49,581
None survived.

1144
01:59:50,290 --> 01:59:52,292
Fear.

1145
01:59:52,834 --> 01:59:56,046
The city is rank with it.

1146
01:59:58,382 --> 02:00:00,842
Let us ease their pain.

1147
02:00:01,093 --> 02:00:02,844
Release the prisoners.

1148
02:00:03,011 --> 02:00:04,972
Catapults!

1149
02:00:18,318 --> 02:00:21,780
My sons are spent.

1150
02:00:22,823 --> 02:00:25,742
My line has ended.

1151
02:00:28,579 --> 02:00:29,997
He's alive!

1152
02:00:30,163 --> 02:00:33,333
The House of Stewards has failed.

1153
02:00:33,500 --> 02:00:34,960
He needs medicine, my lord.

1154
02:00:36,003 --> 02:00:38,672
My line has ended!

1155
02:00:40,173 --> 02:00:42,175
My lord!

1156
02:00:55,689 --> 02:00:57,524
Rohan...

1157
02:00:58,275 --> 02:01:00,694
...has deserted us.

1158
02:01:15,125 --> 02:01:18,337
Théoden's betrayed me.

1159
02:01:29,473 --> 02:01:31,308
Abandon your posts!

1160
02:01:32,351 --> 02:01:36,271
Flee! Flee for your lives!

1161
02:01:46,406 --> 02:01:47,950
Prepare for battle!

1162
02:01:48,492 --> 02:01:51,662
Hurry, men! To the wall! Defend the wall!

1163
02:01:52,829 --> 02:01:54,790
Over here!

1164
02:01:55,540 --> 02:01:57,918
Return to your posts!

1165
02:02:08,720 --> 02:02:11,348
Send these foul beasts into the abyss.

1166
02:02:21,525 --> 02:02:22,985
Stay where you are.

1167
02:02:39,960 --> 02:02:41,378
We need more rubble!

1168
02:02:41,545 --> 02:02:43,422
Watch out!

1169
02:02:43,589 --> 02:02:46,133
Down to the lower levels. Quick!

1170
02:02:48,010 --> 02:02:49,553
Double up, men!

Aim for the trolls! Kill the trolls!

1184

Bring them down!

1185
02:05:28,712 --> 02:05:30,756
Fight them back!

1186
02:05:30,923 --> 02:05:32,925
Peregrin Took!

1187
02:05:33,800 --> 02:05:36,970
-Go back to the Citadel!
-They'd called us out to fight.

1188
02:05:52,653 --> 02:05:55,030
This is no place for a Hobbit.

1189
02:06:20,764 --> 02:06:22,224
Guard of the Citadel, indeed.

1190
02:06:22,849 --> 02:06:26,186
Now, back, up the hill. Quickly. Quick!

1191
02:06:37,531 --> 02:06:40,492
What are you doing,
you useless scum?!

1192
02:06:40,659 --> 02:06:42,619
The door won't give. It's too strong.

1193
02:06:48,959 --> 02:06:51,378
Get back there and smash it down.

1194
02:06:51,545 --> 02:06:53,547
But nothing can breach it.

1195
02:06:56,466 --> 02:06:58,719
Grond will breach it.

1196
02:07:02,139 --> 02:07:04,224
Bring up the wolf's head.

1197
02:07:07,394 --> 02:07:12,733
<i>Grond! Grond! Grond! Grond!</i>

1198
02:07:13,066 --> 02:07:16,904
<i>Grond! Grond! Grond!</i>

1199
02:07:18,822 --> 02:07:22,242
<i>Grond! Grond! Grond!</i>

1200

<i>Grond! Grond! Grond!</i>

1201
02:07:27,039 --> 02:07:31,209
<i>Grond! Grond! Grond!</i>

1202
02:07:31,376 --> 02:07:35,088
<i>Grond! Grond! Grond!</i>

1203
02:07:48,894 --> 02:07:50,688
You may go no further.

1204
02:07:53,899 --> 02:07:56,861
You will not enter Gondor.

1205
02:07:57,278 --> 02:07:59,613
Who are you to deny us passage?

1206
02:07:59,780 --> 02:08:03,534
Legolas, fire a warning shot
past the bosun's ear.

1207
02:08:05,786 --> 02:08:07,455
Mind your aim.

1208
02:08:14,170 --> 02:08:16,547
That's it. Right. We warned you.

1209
02:08:16,714 --> 02:08:18,924
Prepare to be boarded.

1210
02:08:20,301 --> 02:08:21,552
Boarded?

1211
02:08:21,719 --> 02:08:23,387
By you and whose army?

1212
02:08:24,930 --> 02:08:27,224
This army.

1213
02:08:43,908 --> 02:08:45,743
In there.

1214
02:08:47,411 --> 02:08:49,288
What is this place?

1215
02:08:53,709 --> 02:08:57,088
Master must go inside the tunnel.

1216
02:08:58,464 --> 02:09:02,468
Now that I'm here, I don't think I want to.

1217
02:09:04,553 --> 02:09:06,806
It's the only way.

1218
02:09:09,183 --> 02:09:11,185
Go in...

1219
02:09:11,727 --> 02:09:13,938
...or go back.

1220
02:09:16,607 --> 02:09:19,402
I can't go back.

1221
02:09:31,580 --> 02:09:34,291
-What's that smell?
-Orcses' filth.

1222
02:09:34,458 --> 02:09:37,711
Orcses come in here sometimes.

1223
02:09:42,675 --> 02:09:44,552
Hurry.

1224
02:09:49,432 --> 02:09:51,392
This way.

1225
02:09:54,228 --> 02:09:56,021
Sméagol?

1226
02:09:56,981 --> 02:09:59,150
Over here.

1227
02:10:07,450 --> 02:10:10,619
It's sticky. What is it?

1228
02:10:10,786 --> 02:10:13,080
You'll see.

1229
02:10:13,247 --> 02:10:15,583
Oh, yes.

1230
02:10:15,750 --> 02:10:18,919
You will see.

1231
02:10:27,803 --> 02:10:29,472
Sméagol?

1232
02:10:30,765 --> 02:10:32,058
Sméagol!

1233
02:10:34,769 --> 02:10:36,687
Sméagol!

1234
02:10:45,946 --> 02:10:47,907
Sam.

1235
02:12:27,965 --> 02:12:30,092
<i>And you, Frodo Baggins...</i>

1236

in dark places...</i>

1238
02:12:39,894 --> 02:12:43,500

02:14:06,981 --> 02:14:10,317
<i>Caught in a web</i>

1243
02:14:10,484 --> 02:14:13,237
<i>Soon you'll be...</i>

1244
02:14:13,612 --> 02:14:15,448
Eaten.

1245
02:14:52,610 --> 02:14:55,321
Got away, did it, precious?

1246
02:14:55,488 --> 02:14:57,615
Not this time.

1247
02:14:57,782 --> 02:15:00,868
-Not this time!
-No!

1248
02:15:07,708 --> 02:15:11,045
It wasn't us. It wasn't us!

1249
02:15:11,504 --> 02:15:14,131
Sméagol wouldn't hurt master.

1250
02:15:14,298 --> 02:15:16,217
We promised.

1251
02:15:16,384 --> 02:15:18,886
You must believe us.

1252
02:15:19,053 --> 02:15:20,763
It was the precious.

1253
02:15:20,930 --> 02:15:25,726
The precious made us do it.

1254
02:15:42,827 --> 02:15:45,746
I have to destroy it, Sméagol.

1255
02:15:54,755 --> 02:15:58,092
I have to destroy it for both our sakes.

1256
02:16:08,269 --> 02:16:09,603
No!

1257
02:16:32,835 --> 02:16:35,254
I'm so sorry, Sam.

1258
02:16:39,717 --> 02:16:42,303
I'm so sorry.

1259
02:17:08,037 --> 02:17:12,875
<i>This task was appointed to you,
Frodo of the Shire.</i>

1260
02:17:14,001 --> 02:17:16,420
<i>If you do not find a way...</i>

1261
02:17:17,671 --> 02:17:18,923
<i>...no one will.</i>

1262
02:17:52,748 --> 02:17:55,501
The scouts report
Minas Tirith is surrounded.

1263
02:17:55,668 --> 02:17:57,962
The lower level's in flames.

1264
02:17:58,421 --> 02:18:00,881
Everywhere,
legions of the enemy advance.

1265
02:18:01,048 --> 02:18:02,258
Time is against us.

1266
02:18:02,842 --> 02:18:04,176
Make ready!

1267
02:18:04,343 --> 02:18:06,178
Take heart, Merry.

1268
02:18:06,345 --> 02:18:08,556
It will soon be over.

1269
02:18:09,140 --> 02:18:10,725
My lady...

1270
02:18:11,308 --> 02:18:13,894
...you are fair and brave...

1271
02:18:14,228 --> 02:18:16,647
...and have much to live for...

1272
02:18:17,982 --> 02:18:20,401
...and many who love you.

1273
02:18:23,154 --> 02:18:25,906
I know it is too late to turn aside.

1274
02:18:26,449 --> 02:18:29,660
I know there is not much point
now in hoping.

1275
02:18:30,870 --> 02:18:34,290
If I were a knight of Rohan,
capable of great deeds...

1276
02:18:34,457 --> 02:18:37,585
But I'm not.

1277
02:18:37,752 --> 02:18:39,587
I'm a Hobbit.

1278
02:18:42,298 --> 02:18:44,800
And I know I can't save Middle-earth.

1279
02:18:48,179 --> 02:18:50,514
I just want to help my friends.

1280
02:18:52,600 --> 02:18:54,101
Frodo.

1281
02:18:54,894 --> 02:18:56,687
Sam.

1282
02:18:58,272 --> 02:19:00,316
Pippin.

1283
02:19:01,734 --> 02:19:04,820
More than anything,
I wish I could see them again.

1284
02:19:09,033 --> 02:19:11,368
Prepare to move out!

1285
02:19:11,535 --> 02:19:14,330
Make haste.
We ride through the night.

1286
02:19:30,971 --> 02:19:32,306
To battle.

1287
02:19:32,723 --> 02:19:34,225
To battle.

1288
02:19:57,248 --> 02:19:59,041
Back to the gate!

1289
02:19:59,333 --> 02:20:01,502
Hurry!

1290
02:20:21,397 --> 02:20:25,901
I am steward of the House of Anárion.

1291
02:20:26,068 --> 02:20:28,446
Thus have I walked.

1292
02:20:29,655 --> 02:20:32,742
And thus now will I sleep.

1293
02:20:38,789 --> 02:20:40,916
Gondor is lost.

1294
02:20:41,375 --> 02:20:44,837
There is no hope for Men.

1295
02:20:59,435 --> 02:21:02,271
Why do the fools fly?

1296
02:21:03,814 --> 02:21:06,901
Better to die sooner than late.

1297
02:21:09,028 --> 02:21:11,113
For die we must.

1298
02:21:23,250 --> 02:21:26,295
No tomb for Denethor
and Faramir.

1299
02:21:27,421 --> 02:21:33,427
No long, slow sleep of death embalmed.

1300
02:21:33,594 --> 02:21:38,766
We shall burn,
like the heathen kings of old.

1301
02:21:42,436 --> 02:21:44,271
Bring wood and oil.

1302
02:21:47,024 --> 02:21:48,442
Steady.

1303
02:21:48,609 --> 02:21:50,653
Steady.

1304
02:22:05,042 --> 02:22:07,628
You are soldiers of Gondor.

1305
02:22:07,837 --> 02:22:12,299
No matter what comes through that gate,
you will stand your ground.

1306
02:22:18,764 --> 02:22:19,932
Run!

1307
02:22:21,851 --> 02:22:23,352
Volley!

1308
02:22:24,103 --> 02:22:25,980
Fire!

1309
02:24:19,135 --> 02:24:21,178
Let him go, you filth.

1310
02:24:23,097 --> 02:24:24,765
Let him go!

1311
02:24:26,016 --> 02:24:28,185
You will not touch him again.

1312
02:24:31,313 --> 02:24:33,190
Come on and finish it.

1313
02:26:22,925 --> 02:26:24,552
Back!

1314
02:26:35,354 --> 02:26:36,647
Mr. Frodo.

1315
02:26:46,198 --> 02:26:48,200
Oh, no.

1316
02:26:48,367 --> 02:26:50,327
Frodo.

1317
02:26:50,619 --> 02:26:52,496
Mr. Frodo.

1318
02:26:57,084 --> 02:26:58,419
Wake up.

1319
02:27:02,256 --> 02:27:04,633
Don't leave me here alone.

1320
02:27:06,135 --> 02:27:08,596
Don't go where I can't follow.

1321
02:27:12,892 --> 02:27:14,268
Wake up.

1322
02:27:20,941 --> 02:27:23,152
Not asleep.

1323
02:27:25,279 --> 02:27:27,198
Dead.

1324
02:27:45,966 --> 02:27:47,468
You get back, you scum!

1325
02:27:57,061 --> 02:27:58,396
What's this?

1326
02:27:59,563 --> 02:28:02,316
Looks like old Shelob's
been having a bit of fun.

1327
02:28:04,318 --> 02:28:06,821
Killed another one, has she?

1328
02:28:07,029 --> 02:28:08,989
No.

1329
02:28:11,700 --> 02:28:13,702
This fellow ain't dead.

1330
02:28:14,036 --> 02:28:16,330
Not dead?

1331
02:28:16,497 --> 02:28:22,294
She jabs him with her stinger,
and he goes as limp as a boned fish.

1332
02:28:22,628 --> 02:28:25,381
Then she has her way with them.

1333
02:28:25,715 --> 02:28:27,425
That's how she likes to feed.

1334
02:28:27,925 --> 02:28:30,052
Fresh blood.

1335
02:28:30,219 --> 02:28:32,555
Get him to the tower!

1336
02:28:36,016 --> 02:28:37,727
Samwise, you fool.

1337
02:28:37,893 --> 02:28:40,730
This scum will be awake
in a couple of hours.

1338
02:28:40,896 --> 02:28:43,399
Then he'll wish he'd never been born.

1339
02:29:07,673 --> 02:29:10,926
The house of his spirit crumbles.

1340
02:29:11,969 --> 02:29:13,429
He is burning.

1341
02:29:14,555 --> 02:29:15,890
Already burning.

1342
02:29:16,265 --> 02:29:18,267
He's not dead.

1343
02:29:18,726 --> 02:29:20,394
He's not dead!

1344
02:29:22,605 --> 02:29:24,398
No! No!

1345
02:29:24,565 --> 02:29:26,901
No! No!

1346
02:29:27,068 --> 02:29:29,070
He's not dead!

1347
02:29:29,445 --> 02:29:32,907
-Farewell, Peregrin, son of Paladin.
-No! No! No!

1348
02:29:33,074 --> 02:29:36,410
I release you from my service.

1349
02:29:37,745 --> 02:29:42,083
Go now and die in what way
seems best to you.

1350
02:29:44,251 --> 02:29:46,587
Pour oil on the wood!

1351
02:29:48,297 --> 02:29:50,341
Come on, soldier! Move it!

1352
02:29:50,841 --> 02:29:53,761
-Hurry along there! Hurry along!
-Gandalf!

1353
02:29:54,136 --> 02:29:55,596
Where is Gandalf?

1354
02:29:56,722 --> 02:29:58,099
Gandalf!

1355
02:30:03,437 --> 02:30:04,605
Retreat!

1356
02:30:06,774 --> 02:30:08,526
The city is breached!

1357
02:30:08,692 --> 02:30:11,654
Fall back to the second level!

1358
02:30:15,449 --> 02:30:17,034
Get the women and children out!

1359
02:30:17,410 --> 02:30:19,161
Get them out!

1360
02:30:19,328 --> 02:30:20,630
Retreat!

Gandalf!

Denethor has lost his mind!

1374
02:31:12,757 --> 02:31:15,051
He's burning Faramir alive!

1375
02:31:15,217 --> 02:31:17,011
Up! Quickly!

1376
02:31:23,851 --> 02:31:25,352
Go back to the abyss.

1377
02:31:26,854 --> 02:31:30,024
Fall into the nothingness
that awaits you and your master.

1378
02:31:30,191 --> 02:31:36,697
Do you not know death when you see it,
old man?

1379
02:31:36,864 --> 02:31:41,535
This is my hour.

02:31:51,087 --> 02:31:52,671
Gandalf!

1381
02:32:01,555 --> 02:32:05,101
You have failed.

1382
02:32:05,893 --> 02:32:10,731
The world of Men will fall.

1383
02:33:07,997 --> 02:33:09,457
Courage, Merry.

1384
02:33:09,623 --> 02:33:12,001
Courage for our friends.

1385
02:33:15,546 --> 02:33:18,632
Form ranks, you maggots. Form ranks!

1386
02:33:18,799 --> 02:33:22,053
Pikes in front. Archers behind.

1387
02:33:30,144 --> 02:33:33,314
Éomer, take your éored
down the left flank.

1388
02:33:33,481 --> 02:33:34,732
Flank ready.

1389
02:33:34,899 --> 02:33:37,777
Gamling, follow the king's banner
down the center.

1390
02:33:37,943 --> 02:33:41,655
Grimbold, take your company right
after you pass the wall.

1391
02:33:41,822 --> 02:33:44,575
Forth, and fear no darkness!

1392
02:33:44,742 --> 02:33:48,579
Arise, arise, Riders of Théoden!

1393
02:33:48,829 --> 02:33:54,001
Spears shall be shaken,
shields shall be splintered...

1394
02:33:54,210 --> 02:33:57,922
...a sword-day, a red day...

...ere the sun rises!

1396

Whatever happens, stay with me.
I'll look after you.

1397

Ride now!

1398
02:34:23,697 --> 02:34:25,825
Ride now!

1399
02:34:26,409 --> 02:34:29,203
Ride! Ride for ruin...

1400
02:34:29,370 --> 02:34:32,123
...and the world's ending!

1401

Forth Eorlingas!

1409
02:35:49,825 --> 02:35:51,118
Charge!

1410
02:35:51,577 --> 02:35:53,162
Fire at will!

1411
02:36:50,511 --> 02:36:53,806
Set a fire in our flesh.

1412
02:37:11,449 --> 02:37:13,200
Stay this madness!

1413
02:37:17,538 --> 02:37:22,126
You may triumph in the field of battle
for a day...

1414
02:37:22,710 --> 02:37:26,297
...but against the power that has risen
in the east...

1415
02:37:26,464 --> 02:37:29,717
...there is no victory.

1416
02:37:58,913 --> 02:38:00,664
No!

1417
02:38:00,831 --> 02:38:03,501
You will not take my son from me!

1418
02:38:03,667 --> 02:38:06,003
No! No!

1419
02:38:16,931 --> 02:38:18,599
Faramir.

1420
02:38:32,154 --> 02:38:36,117
So passes Denethor, son of Ecthelion.

02:44:01,442 --> 02:44:02,860
End?

1438
02:44:04,111 --> 02:44:06,238
No, the journey doesn't end here.

1439
02:44:08,741 --> 02:44:11,869
Death is just another path...

1440
02:44:12,453 --> 02:44:14,121
...one that we all must take.

1441
02:44:15,373 --> 02:44:18,834
The grey rain curtain
of this world rolls back...

1442
02:44:19,001 --> 02:44:22,630
...and all turns to silver glass.

1443
02:44:24,799 --> 02:44:26,759
And then you see it.

1444
02:44:28,677 --> 02:44:31,055
What, Gandalf?

1445
02:44:32,181 --> 02:44:33,516
See what?

1446
02:44:34,767 --> 02:44:36,977
White shores...

1447
02:44:38,646 --> 02:44:41,065
...and beyond.

1448
02:44:42,525 --> 02:44:44,318
A far green country...

1449
02:44:45,027 --> 02:44:47,947
...under a swift sunrise.

1450
02:44:51,992 --> 02:44:53,494
Well...

1451
02:44:53,661 --> 02:44:55,329
...that isn't so bad.

1452
02:44:55,496 --> 02:44:56,914
No.

1453
02:44:58,958 --> 02:45:00,626
No, it isn't.

1454
02:45:17,017 --> 02:45:20,354
Rally to me! To me!

1455
02:45:41,125 --> 02:45:45,671
Feast on his flesh.

1456
02:45:50,009 --> 02:45:52,386
I will kill you if you touch him.

1457
02:45:52,553 --> 02:45:58,017
Do not come between
the Nazgûl and his prey.

Get off your ships!

No, Merry.

1530
02:57:17,655 --> 02:57:19,907
I'm going to look after you.

1531
02:58:03,909 --> 02:58:05,327
Hands off!

1532
02:58:05,494 --> 02:58:08,664
That shiny shirt, that's mine.

1533
02:58:08,914 --> 02:58:13,085
It's going to the Great Eye,
along with everything else.

1534
02:58:14,628 --> 02:58:18,466
I don't take orders from
stinking Morgul-rats!

1535
02:58:19,300 --> 02:58:24,472
You touch it, and I'll stick
this blade in your gut.

1536
02:58:45,159 --> 02:58:46,952
The scum tried to knife me.

1537
02:58:47,119 --> 02:58:48,871
Kill him!

1538
03:00:32,099 --> 03:00:34,101
That's for Frodo!

1539
03:00:34,477 --> 03:00:36,604
And for the Shire!

1540
03:00:40,191 --> 03:00:42,318
And that's for my old Gaffer!

1541
03:01:11,806 --> 03:01:15,142
Stop your squealing, you dunghill rat.

1542
03:01:16,268 --> 03:01:20,981
I'm gonna bleed you like a stuck pig.

1543
03:01:28,322 --> 03:01:29,990
Not if I stick you first.

1544
03:01:30,157 --> 03:01:31,701
Sam!

1545
03:01:36,747 --> 03:01:38,791
Oh, Sam, I'm so sorry.

1546
03:01:38,958 --> 03:01:41,001
Sorry for everything.

1547
03:01:41,502 --> 03:01:45,172
-Let's get you out of here.
-It's too late. It's over.

1548
03:01:45,339 --> 03:01:48,217
They've taken it. Sam...

1549
03:01:49,009 --> 03:01:50,511
...they took the Ring.

1550
03:01:51,262 --> 03:01:53,973
Begging your pardon, but they haven't.

1551
03:02:05,943 --> 03:02:08,154
I thought I'd lost you.

1552
03:02:08,529 --> 03:02:10,239
So I took it.

1553
03:02:11,407 --> 03:02:13,492
Only for safekeeping.

1554
03:02:14,744 --> 03:02:16,495
Give it to me.

1555
03:02:20,041 --> 03:02:22,251
Give me the Ring, Sam.

1556
03:02:26,922 --> 03:02:28,174
Sam.

1557
03:02:29,759 --> 03:02:31,719
Give me the Ring.

1558
03:02:52,448 --> 03:02:53,741
You must understand.

1559
03:02:57,244 --> 03:02:59,080
The Ring is my burden.

1560
03:03:00,247 --> 03:03:02,416
It will destroy you, Sam.

1561
03:03:05,586 --> 03:03:07,546
Come on, Mr. Frodo.

1562
03:03:08,881 --> 03:03:10,508
We best find you some clothes.

1563
03:03:10,674 --> 03:03:13,719
You can't go walking through Mordor
in naught but your skin.

1564
03:03:35,449 --> 03:03:37,660
We did it, Mr. Frodo.

1565
03:03:38,160 --> 03:03:40,454
We made it to Mordor.

1566
03:03:41,789 --> 03:03:43,457
There are so many of them.

1567
03:03:44,417 --> 03:03:47,002
We'll never get through unseen.

1568
03:03:52,133 --> 03:03:55,469
It's him, the Eye.

1569
03:04:03,185 --> 03:04:05,813
We have to go in there, Mr. Frodo.

1570
03:04:06,272 --> 03:04:08,315
There's nothing for it.

1571
03:04:11,318 --> 03:04:15,740
Come on. Let's just make it
down the hill for starters.

1572
03:04:25,082 --> 03:04:28,335
Frodo has passed beyond my sight.

1573
03:04:29,670 --> 03:04:32,506
The darkness is deepening.

1574
03:04:32,673 --> 03:04:35,051
If Sauron had the Ring,
we would know it.

1575
03:04:35,217 --> 03:04:37,261
It's only a matter of time.

1576
03:04:38,763 --> 03:04:41,182
He has suffered a defeat, yes...

1577
03:04:42,224 --> 03:04:46,729
...but behind the walls of Mordor,
our enemy is regrouping.

1578
03:04:46,896 --> 03:04:48,731
Let him stay there.

1579
03:04:48,898 --> 03:04:51,567
Let him rot! Why should we care?

1580
03:04:51,734 --> 03:04:56,906
Because 10,000 Orcs now stand
between Frodo and Mount Doom.

1581
03:05:03,662 --> 03:05:06,165
I've sent him to his death.

1582
03:05:07,708 --> 03:05:09,001
No.

1583
03:05:09,502 --> 03:05:11,921
There is still hope for Frodo.

1584
03:05:12,254 --> 03:05:16,384
He needs time and safe passage
across the plains of Gorgoroth.

1585
03:05:17,468 --> 03:05:20,054
-We can give him that.
-How?

1586
03:05:20,388 --> 03:05:23,099
Draw out Sauron's armies.

1587
03:05:23,265 --> 03:05:25,393
Empty his lands.

1588
03:05:25,601 --> 03:05:28,687
Then we gather our full strength
and march on the Black Gate.

1589
03:05:29,313 --> 03:05:32,316
We cannot achieve victory
through strength of arms.

1590
03:05:32,483 --> 03:05:34,068
Not for ourselves.

1591
03:05:34,276 --> 03:05:39,865
But we can give Frodo his chance
if we keep Sauron's Eye fixed upon us.

1592
03:05:41,659 --> 03:05:45,454
Keep him blind to all else that moves.

1593
03:05:46,205 --> 03:05:47,415
A diversion.

1594
03:05:47,581 --> 03:05:49,375
Certainty of death...

1595
03:05:49,542 --> 03:05:52,294
...small chance of success...

1596
03:05:53,170 --> 03:05:54,755
...what are we waiting for?

1597
03:05:55,339 --> 03:05:57,758
Sauron will suspect a trap.

1598
03:05:58,551 --> 03:06:00,594
He will not take the bait.

1599
03:06:02,096 --> 03:06:04,598
Oh, I think he will.

1609
03:07:40,027 --> 03:07:43,072
There is no warmth left in the sun.

1610
03:07:43,864 --> 03:07:45,574
It grows so cold.

1611
03:07:48,577 --> 03:07:51,622
It's just the damp
of the first spring rain.

1612

I do not believe this darkness
will endure.

Look, the Orcs...

1614
03:08:31,954 --> 03:08:33,956
...they're moving off.

1615
03:08:34,999 --> 03:08:37,084
You see, Mr. Frodo...

1616
03:08:37,251 --> 03:08:39,587
...some luck at last.

1617
03:08:39,754 --> 03:08:41,589
Move it, you slugs!

1618
03:08:42,882 --> 03:08:46,260
Come on! Faster!

1619
03:08:54,268 --> 03:08:57,521
Come along, you scum...

1620
03:08:57,688 --> 03:09:01,942
I'll whip you down to the bone, you...

1621
03:09:04,820 --> 03:09:06,447
Come on!

1622
03:09:06,614 --> 03:09:08,949
What have I told you?!

1623
03:09:15,790 --> 03:09:17,291
Get up!

1624
03:09:17,666 --> 03:09:20,336
Come on, you slugs!

1625
03:09:20,503 --> 03:09:24,131
You two are going straight
to the front line!

1626
03:09:24,298 --> 03:09:29,220
Now, move it! Go on!
Fall in! Move it!

1627
03:09:42,191 --> 03:09:46,028
To the Gate, you slugs!
Now, move it!

1628
03:09:55,413 --> 03:09:58,999
Don't you know we're at war?

1629
03:10:21,313 --> 03:10:24,191
Company, halt!

1630
03:10:28,029 --> 03:10:31,407
Inspection!

1631
03:10:31,574 --> 03:10:34,035
Sam, help me.

1632
03:10:34,201 --> 03:10:36,037
Mr. Frodo!

1633
03:10:38,748 --> 03:10:41,292
Stand up, Mr. Frodo.
Stand up!

1634
03:10:41,459 --> 03:10:43,294
It's so heavy.

1635
03:10:52,428 --> 03:10:53,596
Oh, no.

1636
03:10:59,226 --> 03:11:01,228
What do I do?
What do we do?

1637
03:11:04,273 --> 03:11:05,441
-Hit me.
-What?

1638
03:11:05,608 --> 03:11:07,651
Hit me, Sam. Start fighting.

1639
03:11:07,818 --> 03:11:09,403
Get off of me!

1640
03:11:10,071 --> 03:11:12,406
Nobody pushes me, you filthy maggot.

1641
03:11:21,040 --> 03:11:23,084
Get off of me!

1642
03:11:24,001 --> 03:11:25,920
Break it up! Break it up!

1643
03:11:28,464 --> 03:11:33,010
Oi! I'll have your guts if you don't
shut this rabble down!

1644
03:11:33,219 --> 03:11:35,554
Go, Sam. Now!

1645
03:11:44,480 --> 03:11:46,023
Move along, scum!

1646
03:11:46,190 --> 03:11:48,109
Back in the line!

1647
03:11:48,609 --> 03:11:50,403
You maggots!

1648
03:11:51,070 --> 03:11:54,073
Get back into the line,
you slugs!

1649
03:11:56,492 --> 03:11:59,954
Dig it, you slugs. Move it.

1650
03:12:02,665 --> 03:12:04,625
Move it!

1651
03:12:48,753 --> 03:12:50,796
I can't...

1652
03:12:50,963 --> 03:12:54,717
I can't...
I can't manage the Ring, Sam.

1653
03:12:54,925 --> 03:12:56,052
It's... It's...

1654
03:12:56,218 --> 03:12:58,804
It's such a weight to carry.

1655
03:12:59,680 --> 03:13:00,723
It...

1656
03:13:00,890 --> 03:13:02,850
Such a weight.

1657
03:13:07,855 --> 03:13:10,274
We're going that way.
Straight as we can.

1658
03:13:11,734 --> 03:13:14,862
There's no point carrying anything
we're not sure to need.

1659
03:13:30,044 --> 03:13:31,879
Mr. Frodo.

1660
03:13:33,381 --> 03:13:34,882
Look.

1661
03:13:37,468 --> 03:13:39,303
There is light...

1662
03:13:39,637 --> 03:13:42,056
...and beauty up there...

1663
03:13:42,223 --> 03:13:43,933
...that no shadow can touch.

1664
03:14:34,984 --> 03:14:36,610
Take mine.

1665
03:14:37,111 --> 03:14:39,238
There's a few drops left.

1666
03:14:54,462 --> 03:14:57,048
There will be none left
for the return journey.

1667
03:14:57,965 --> 03:15:01,135
I don't think there will be
a return journey, Mr. Frodo.

1668
03:15:54,021 --> 03:15:56,190
Frodo, get down!

1669
03:15:57,942 --> 03:15:59,860
Hide!

1670
03:16:09,995 --> 03:16:12,039
Frodo!

1671
03:16:17,878 --> 03:16:19,296
Where are they?

1672
03:16:55,374 --> 03:16:58,419
Let the Lord of the Black Land come forth!

1673
03:16:59,336 --> 03:17:02,173
Let justice be done upon him!

1674
03:17:45,674 --> 03:17:49,637
My master, Sauron the Great,
bids thee welcome.

1675
03:17:55,476 --> 03:17:59,188
Is there any in this rout
with authority to treat with me?

1676
03:17:59,563 --> 03:18:02,692
We do not come to treat with Sauron...

1677
03:18:02,858 --> 03:18:05,820
...faithless and accursed.

1678
03:18:05,986 --> 03:18:09,407
Tell your master this:
The armies of Mordor must disband.

1679
03:18:09,573 --> 03:18:12,243
He is to depart these lands,
never to return.

1680
03:18:13,285 --> 03:18:15,830
Old Greybeard.

1681
03:18:17,248 --> 03:18:21,544
I have a token I was bidden
to show thee.

1682
03:18:26,549 --> 03:18:27,883
Frodo.

1683
03:18:30,720 --> 03:18:32,179
Frodo.

1684
03:18:33,180 --> 03:18:34,390
-Silence.
-No!

1685
03:18:35,224 --> 03:18:36,559
Silence!

1686
03:18:38,352 --> 03:18:42,106
The Halfling was dear to thee, I see.

1687
03:18:43,107 --> 03:18:47,194
Know that he suffered greatly
at the hands of his host.

1688
03:18:52,700 --> 03:18:58,456
Who would've thought one so small
could endure so much pain?

1689
03:19:01,083 --> 03:19:03,210
And he did, Gandalf.

1690
03:19:03,377 --> 03:19:05,129
He did.

1691
03:19:12,136 --> 03:19:13,637
And who is this?

1692
03:19:13,804 --> 03:19:15,890
Isildur's heir?

1693
03:19:16,057 --> 03:19:19,060
It takes more to make a king
than a broken Elvish blade.

1694
03:19:23,814 --> 03:19:26,400
I guess that concludes negotiations.

1695
03:19:28,527 --> 03:19:29,737
I do not believe it.

1696
03:19:31,739 --> 03:19:33,115
I will not.


1697

1698
03:19:49,215 --> 03:19:51,008
Pull back.

1699
03:19:51,300 --> 03:19:53,344
Pull back!

1700
03:20:05,564 --> 03:20:07,608
It's gone, Mr. Frodo.

1701
03:20:10,069 --> 03:20:13,072
The light's passed on,
away towards the north.

1702
03:20:13,280 --> 03:20:15,074
Something's drawn its gaze.

1703
03:20:32,591 --> 03:20:35,344
Hold your ground! Hold your ground.

1704
03:20:37,430 --> 03:20:41,434
Sons of Gondor, of Rohan, my brothers!

1705
03:20:44,311 --> 03:20:46,188
I see in your eyes...

1706
03:20:46,564 --> 03:20:50,609
...the same fear that would take
the heart of me.

1707
03:20:52,570 --> 03:20:56,490
A day may come
when the courage of Men fails...

1708
03:20:56,657 --> 03:20:59,952
...when we forsake our friends
and break all bonds of fellowship.

1709
03:21:00,119 --> 03:21:02,788
But it is not this day.

1710
03:21:03,080 --> 03:21:06,125
An hour of wolves
and shattered shields...

1711
03:21:06,292 --> 03:21:09,170
...when the age of Men
comes crashing down.

1712
03:21:09,336 --> 03:21:11,797
But it is not this day.

1713
03:21:11,964 --> 03:21:13,632
This day we fight!

1714
03:21:16,093 --> 03:21:19,764
By all that you hold dear
on this good earth...

1715
03:21:19,930 --> 03:21:24,185
...I bid you stand, Men of the West!

1716
03:22:52,648 --> 03:22:56,193
Never thought I'd die fighting
side by side with an Elf.

1717
03:22:56,652 --> 03:22:58,988
What about side by side with a friend?

1718
03:23:02,533 --> 03:23:04,285
Aye.

1719
03:23:05,119 --> 03:23:06,912
I could do that.

lt'll be spring soon.

1725
03:23:45,326 --> 03:23:48,037
And the orchards will be in blossom.

1726
03:23:48,204 --> 03:23:51,874

No, Sam.

03:24:10,559 --> 03:24:13,521
I can't recall the taste of food...

1734

...nor the sound of water...

1735

1736

I'm...

No veil between me
and the wheel of fire.

1740

I can see him...

03:46:37,490 --> 03:46:39,575
My friends...

1871
03:46:44,872 --> 03:46:47,541
...you bow to no one.

1872
03:47:31,711 --> 03:47:33,838
And thus it was.

1873
03:47:34,004 --> 03:47:37,633
A Fourth Age of Middle-earth began.

1874
03:47:37,800 --> 03:47:40,344
And the Fellowship of the Ring...

1875
03:47:40,511 --> 03:47:45,016
...though eternally bound
by friendship and love...

1876
03:47:45,182 --> 03:47:47,601
...was ended.

1877
03:47:52,606 --> 03:47:57,403
Thirteen months to the day since Gandalf
sent us on our long journey...

1878
03:47:57,570 --> 03:48:01,782
...we found ourselves
looking upon a familiar sight.

1879
03:48:04,326 --> 03:48:07,038
We were home.

1880
03:48:13,586 --> 03:48:15,463
Hi.

1881
03:48:32,646 --> 03:48:34,857
Hey, watch the pumpkin.

1882
03:49:22,947 --> 03:49:24,532
More of the same, Rosie.

1883
03:49:24,699 --> 03:49:26,701
Good night, lads.

1884
03:50:24,258 --> 03:50:28,262
How do you pick up the threads
of an old life?

1885
03:50:29,597 --> 03:50:31,807
How do you go on...

1886
03:50:31,974 --> 03:50:37,188
...when in your heart
you begin to understand...

1887
03:50:38,439 --> 03:50:41,400
...there is no going back?

1888
03:50:42,109 --> 03:50:45,780
There are some things
that time cannot mend...

1889
03:50:46,280 --> 03:50:49,200
...some hurts that go too deep...

1890
03:50:50,951 --> 03:50:53,788
...that have taken hold.

1891
03:51:14,475 --> 03:51:17,520
there and back again...
a hobbit's tale, by Bilbo Baggins

1892
03:51:31,951 --> 03:51:33,828
Mr. Frodo?

1893
03:51:37,164 --> 03:51:38,541
What is it?

1894
03:51:40,376 --> 03:51:44,338
It's been four years to the day
since Weathertop, Sam.

1895
03:51:45,006 --> 03:51:47,717
It's never really healed.

1896
03:51:51,679 --> 03:51:56,934
<i>"There and Back Again: A Hobbit's Tale
by Bilbo Baggins.</i>

1897
03:51:57,685 --> 03:52:01,480
<i>And The Lord of the Rings
by Frodo Baggins."</i>

1898
03:52:01,981 --> 03:52:04,150
You finished it.

1899
03:52:07,028 --> 03:52:08,529
Not quite.

1900
03:52:09,363 --> 03:52:11,907
There's room for a little more.

1901
03:52:14,535 --> 03:52:18,748
Bilbo once told me his part
in this tale would end...

1902
03:52:18,914 --> 03:52:22,209
...that each of us must come and go
in the telling.

1903
03:52:23,085 --> 03:52:25,921
Bilbo's story was now over.

1904
03:52:26,422 --> 03:52:29,342
There would be no more journeys
for him...

1905
03:52:29,508 --> 03:52:31,052
...save one.

1906
03:52:31,802 --> 03:52:35,389
Tell me again, lad,
where are we going?

1907
03:52:35,556 --> 03:52:37,558
To the harbour, Bilbo.

1908
03:52:37,725 --> 03:52:40,436
The Elves have accorded you
a special honour...

1909
03:52:40,603 --> 03:52:43,230
...a place on the last ship
to leave Middle-earth.

1910
03:52:44,940 --> 03:52:46,609
Frodo...

1911
03:52:48,027 --> 03:52:52,573
...any chance of seeing
that old Ring of mine again?

1912
03:52:53,199 --> 03:52:55,451
The one I gave you.

1913
03:52:59,080 --> 03:53:01,248
I'm sorry, Uncle.

1914
03:53:03,793 --> 03:53:06,420
I'm afraid I lost it.

1915
03:53:06,587 --> 03:53:08,381
Oh.

1916
03:53:09,006 --> 03:53:10,466
Pity.

1917
03:53:13,219 --> 03:53:17,098
I should like to have held it
one last time.

1918
03:53:46,252 --> 03:53:51,298
Well, here's a sight
I have never seen before.

1919
03:54:05,479 --> 03:54:08,816
The power of the Three Rings is ended.

1920
03:54:09,608 --> 03:54:12,403
The time has come...

1921
03:54:12,570 --> 03:54:15,865
...for the dominion of Men.

1922
03:54:16,400 --> 03:54:19,400
<font color="#008000">I Aear cân ven na mar.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">(The sea calls us home.)</font>

1923
03:54:28,252 --> 03:54:30,421
I think I'm...

1924
03:54:30,588 --> 03:54:34,967
...quite ready
for another adventure.

1925
03:55:06,040 --> 03:55:08,334
Farewell...

1926
03:55:08,501 --> 03:55:11,253
...my brave Hobbits.

1927
03:55:13,214 --> 03:55:15,216
My work is now finished.

1928
03:55:19,136 --> 03:55:24,016
Here at last,
on the shores of the sea...

1929
03:55:24,684 --> 03:55:27,520
...comes the end of our Fellowship.

1930
03:55:31,065 --> 03:55:33,567
I will not say, "Do not weep"...

1931
03:55:34,235 --> 03:55:38,239
...for not all tears are an evil.

1932
03:55:55,798 --> 03:55:57,717
It is time, Frodo.

1933
03:56:03,264 --> 03:56:05,266
What does he mean?

1934
03:56:07,727 --> 03:56:10,604
We set out to save the Shire, Sam.

1935
03:56:12,189 --> 03:56:14,942
And it has been saved.

1936
03:56:18,612 --> 03:56:21,282
But not for me.

1937
03:56:22,199 --> 03:56:24,660
You don't mean that.

1938
03:56:25,870 --> 03:56:27,955
You can't leave.

1939
03:56:36,422 --> 03:56:39,133
The last pages are for you, Sam.

1940
04:00:12,221 --> 04:00:15,099
My dear Sam:

1941
04:00:17,018 --> 04:00:20,354
You cannot always be torn in two.

1942
04:00:20,521 --> 04:00:24,650
You will have to be one and whole
for many years.

1943
04:00:25,401 --> 04:00:30,865
You have so much to enjoy
and to be and to do.

1944
04:00:32,116 --> 04:00:35,286
Your part in the story will go on.

1945
04:00:36,037 --> 04:00:37,788
Well...

1946
04:00:39,665 --> 04:00:41,375
...I'm back.

1947
04:02:23,978 --> 04:02:27,982
<i>Lay down</i>

1948
04:02:29,567 --> 04:02:33,988
<i>Your sweet and weary head</i>

1949
04:02:35,698 --> 04:02:39,285
<i>Night is falling</i>

1950
04:02:39,952 --> 04:02:44,790
<i>You have come
To journey's end</i>

1951
04:02:45,458 --> 04:02:49,211
<i>Sleep now</i>

1952
04:02:49,378 --> 04:02:55,051
<i>And dream
Of the ones who came before</i>

1953
04:02:56,802 --> 04:03:00,723
<i>They are calling</i>

1954
04:03:00,890 --> 04:03:05,019
<i>From across
The distant shore</i>

1955
04:03:06,604 --> 04:03:11,525
<i>Why do you weep?</i>

1956
04:03:11,692 --> 04:03:16,697
<i>What are these tears
Upon your face?</i>

1957
04:03:16,864 --> 04:03:21,911
<i>Soon you will see</i>

1958
04:03:22,078 --> 04:03:27,041
<i>All of your fears
Will pass away</i>

1959
04:03:27,208 --> 04:03:32,296
<i>Safe in my arms</i>

1960
04:03:32,463 --> 04:03:36,967
<i>You're only sleeping</i>

1961
04:03:37,134 --> 04:03:42,139
<i>What can you see</i>

1962
04:03:42,306 --> 04:03:47,561
<i>On the horizon?</i>

1963
04:03:47,728 --> 04:03:52,233
<i>Why do the white gulls</i>

1964
04:03:52,400 --> 04:03:57,113
<i>Call?</i>

1965
04:03:58,280 --> 04:04:02,910
<i>Across the sea</i>

1966
04:04:03,077 --> 04:04:08,332
<i>A pale moon rises</i>

1967
04:04:08,499 --> 04:04:11,210
<i>The ships have come</i>

1968
04:04:11,377 --> 04:04:17,174
<i>To carry you home</i>

1969
04:04:19,427 --> 04:04:23,973
<i>And all will turn</i>

1970
04:04:24,140 --> 04:04:29,478
<i>To silver glass</i>

1971
04:04:29,645 --> 04:04:33,899
<i>A light on the water</i>

1972
04:04:34,066 --> 04:04:39,572
<i>All souls pass</i>

1973
04:04:39,739 --> 04:04:43,951
<i>Hope fades</i>

1974
04:04:45,494 --> 04:04:50,416
<i>Into the world of night</i>

1975
04:04:51,125 --> 04:04:54,962
<i>Through shadows falling</i>

1976
04:04:55,796 --> 04:05:00,926
<i>Out of memory and time</i>

1977
04:05:01,635 --> 04:05:05,348
<i>Don't say</i>

1978
04:05:06,140 --> 04:05:11,145
<i>We have come now to the end</i>

1979
04:05:11,979 --> 04:05:16,400
<i>White shores are calling</i>

1980
04:05:16,567 --> 04:05:20,112
<i>You and I will meet again</i>

1981
04:05:20,279 --> 04:05:26,744
<i>And you'll be here
In my arms</i>

1982
04:05:27,953 --> 04:05:32,041
<i>Just sleeping</i>

1983
04:05:32,208 --> 04:05:37,046
<i>What can you see</i>

1984
04:05:37,213 --> 04:05:42,176
<i>On the horizon?</i>

1985
04:05:42,343 --> 04:05:47,139
<i>Why do the white gulls</i>

1986
04:05:47,306 --> 04:05:52,728
<i>Call?</i>

1987
04:05:52,895 --> 04:05:57,983
<i>Across the sea</i>

1988
04:05:58,150 --> 04:06:03,155
<i>A pale moon rises</i>

1989
04:06:03,322 --> 04:06:06,117
<i>The ships have come</i>

1990
04:06:06,283 --> 04:06:12,623
<i>To carry you home</i>

1991
04:06:13,833 --> 04:06:18,963
<i>And all will turn</i>

1992
04:06:19,547 --> 04:06:24,385
<i>To silver glass</i>

1993
04:06:24,552 --> 04:06:28,681
<i>A light on the water</i>

1994
04:06:28,848 --> 04:06:32,727
<i>Grey ships pass</i>

1995
04:06:32,893 --> 04:06:38,566
<i>Into the West</i>
